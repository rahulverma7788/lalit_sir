0,"Tripti Tandon, advocate for the Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee and Usha Cooperative, which are parties fighting for the rights of sex workers, stated on Thursday that a Supreme Court order on May 19 ""does not recognise or have the effect of recognising sex work as a 'profession'"". Ms. Tandon said the court's order ""states that sex workers, who are otherwise despised and stigmatised by society, must be treated with full respect for their dignity and humanity, as guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution"". The court in its May 19 order, as reported in The Hindu, had highlighted ""that notwithstanding the profession, every individual in this country has a right to a dignified life under Article 21. The constitutional protection that is given to all individuals in this country shall be kept in mind by the authorities who have a duty under Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956"".  In a statement, Ms. Tandon clarified that, following the Union's reservations, the court had agreed to take up, along with the other suggestions of a panel, the recommendation for the ""police not to interfere or take criminal action in case of adult, consensual sex work"" in July, after the government submitted its response. Another panel recommendation the Centre had a reservation about was ""whenever there is a raid on any brothel, since voluntary sex work is not illegal and only running the brothel is unlawful, the sex workers concerned should not be arrested or penalised or harassed or victimised"". While waiting for the Centre's response on this particular panel recommendation, the court has nevertheless called for the strict implementation of the panel's suggestion that the ""police should treat all sex workers with dignity and should not abuse them, both verbally and physically, subject them to violence or coerce them into any sexual activity"". Further, the court has ordered a survey of protective homes under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act to review cases of women ""detained against their will"" and process their release in a time-bound manner. ""The court has directed that the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, which is often used to harass, mistreat or victimise sex workers, must be enforced strictly i.e. with the procedural safeguards and timelines provided therein and in full conformity with Article 21 i.e. protection of the right to life and liberty and respect for the person's dignity,"" Ms. Tandon said.

1,"India's top oil and gas producer ONGC on Thursday said it will invest ₹31,000 crore over the next three years in exploring the Indian sedimentary basin for fuel reserves which could augment the nation's production in its attempt to be self-reliant in the energy sector.  In a statement, ONGC said its board held a meeting on Thursday to firm up its 'Future Exploration Strategy'.  ""The company has drawn up a comprehensive roadmap to further intensify its exploration campaign, allocating a capital expenditure of about ₹31,000 crore in the next three fiscal years during FY 2022-25. This is 150% of its exploration expenditure of ₹20,670 crore in the last three fiscals during FY 2019-22,"" it said.  ONGC said it also plans to leverage international collaborations with reputed global majors for this, for which talks are in an advanced stage.  However, it did not elaborate.  India is 85% dependent on imports to meet its oil needs and half of the natural gas requirement is shipped from abroad. Finding and producing more oil and gas domestically will cut this reliance, helping insulate the domestic market from volatility in international energy prices.  ""This exploration intensification includes activities funded through ONGC's internal program as well as funded and facilitated by the government,"" the statement said.  Under the internal programme, ONGC is trying to probe around 1,700 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas (MMTOE) of yet-to-find (YTF) reserves during FY 2022-25.  The activities here include a state-of-the-art 2D and 3D seismic survey, followed by drilling of around 115-120 wells with an estimated outlay of Rs 10,000 crore every year for the next three years.  In addition, the government's facilitation has resulted in the release of about 96,000 square kilometers of area so far, which was earlier demarcated as a 'No Go' zone. This will further help ONGC achieve its acreage acquisition program of bringing around 5,00,000 sq km under active exploration by 2025.  Under a government-funded program for appraisal of unapprised offshore areas till the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), 70,000 line kilometers (LKM) of state-of-the-art 2D broadband seismic data acquisition, processing and interpretation (API) will be done in three sectors -- west coast, east coast and Andaman offshore.  ONGC will complete the technical bid opening (TBO) for seismic data acquisition by June 2022.  In Andaman Basin, ONGC presently holds two blocks for exploration under the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP).  ""Government of India has also acquired seismic data in some sectors within 'No-Go' areas and few prospects are already identified,"" it said without giving details.  ONGC plans to drill six wells in the next three years (two under ONGC committed work programme and four through government funding).  Reputed global companies/consultants are being invited for the assessment of the basin for future exploration and exploitation plan.  ""ONGC's internal program has three components - re-exploration of mature basins, consolidation of emerging basins and probing of emerging and new basins,"" the statement said.

2,"Pakistan's National Assembly on May 26 passed a bill to abolish the former Imran Khan government's election reforms giving expats the right to vote through I-Voting and the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in the country. The Elections (Amendment) Bill 2022 presented by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Murtaza Javed Abbasi was passed with a majority vote in the lower house, with only members of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) opposing it. Mr. Abbasi, before presenting the bill, presented a motion to allow the bill be sent directly to the Senate for its approval, bypassing the relevant standing committee. The bill is expected to be sent to the Senate on May 27. The current National Assembly would complete its five-year term in August next year, which would be followed by the general elections. However, the prime minister can dissolve parliament any time and call fresh elections. Describing the bill of ""immense significance"", Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) minister Azam Nazeer Tarar recalled the ousted Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government had made multiple amendments to the Election Act, 2017, including those that allowed the use of EVMs and granted overseas Pakistanis the right to vote in general elections. The PTI government had made the amendments through the Elections (Second Amendment) Bill, 2021, which it had bulldozed through the National Assembly along with 32 other legislations on November 17 last year, Mr. Tarar said. The minister also said the bill sought to revive the Elections Act, 2017 in the shape prior to those amendments, ensuring free, fair, and transparent elections. Under the new bill, Mr. Tarar stated, two amendments were being made to Sections 94 and 103 of the act, both pertaining to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) conducting pilot projects for overseas voting and the use of EVMs. He said the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had also expressed its inability to hold elections through I-Voting and EVMs in a short span of time and without proper homework. The amendment under Section 94 of the Election Act, 2017, suggests the ECP may conduct pilot projects for voting by overseas Pakistanis in by-elections to ascertain the technical efficacy, secrecy, security, and financial feasibility of such voting and shall share the results with the government. It said the report would be laid before both houses of Parliament within 15 days from the commencement of a session of a house. According to the law minister, the Election Commission of Pakistan had also raised objections to the use of EVMs. He however clarified the government was not against the use of the technology, and that holding polls using EVMs in a single day was ""impossible"". ""We only have concerns about the misuse of technology as the Results Transmission System had failed in last general elections to favour a particular political party,"" he said. He also dispelled the impression that the amendments were aimed at depriving overseas Pakistanis of their right to vote. ""Overseas Pakistanis are a precious asset of the country and the government does not believe in snatching their right to vote,"" he said. Meanwhile, the PTI has strongly criticised the move and termed it a ""regressive and condemnable act"" of the government led by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sherif. PTI vice-chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi tweeted: ""PTI gave over nine million Overseas Pakistanis the right to vote. Today, this band of thieves and thugs removed this, disenfranchising a staggering number of Pakistanis and barring the use of electronic voting machines."" GDA lawmaker Ghous Bakhsh Mehr, on the other hand, said that EVMs were being used across the world and Pakistan should at least try using them. ""If not the whole country, then use them in some areas,"" he said. During the National Assembly session, details of the expenses for the next general elections were shared. According to the electoral watchdog's estimates, fresh polls will cost about Rs 47.41 billion, of which around Rs 15 billion will be for ensuring security. The election commission had estimated the cost of conducting electronic voting at Rs 5.6 billion, while printing ballot papers would cost Rs 4.83 billion. Further, Rs 1.79 billion would be spent on training polling staff. There are over nine million overseas Pakistanis in different counties and Khan enjoys vast support among them. It is feared that giving them the right to vote may swing results in several constituencies. ","The Elections (Amendment) Bill 2022 passed with a majority vote in the lower house .

4," Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday dedicated to the nation and laid the foundation stone for 11 infrastructure projects worth about ₹31,530 crore in Tamil Nadu, across railways, highways and housing sectors. The projects include the ₹14,872-crore, 262 km Bangalore-Chennai expressway, ₹5,852-crore four-lane elevated road in Neraluru to Dharmapuri section, about ₹2,900 crore worth Railways projects, a natural gas pipeline project and ₹1,428-crore multi-modal logistics park near Chennai. While dedicating these projects to the nation, the Prime Minister said the Government of India was fully focussed on building top-quality and sustainable infrastructure. Modernisation and development was being done, keeping in mind the needs of the future. At the same time, it would merge with local art and culture, he added. These projects are expected to significantly improve socio-economic prosperity in the region, have a transformative impact on several sectors and also help create employment opportunities. For Railways, the Prime Minister laid the foundation stone for the redevelopment of five railway stations in Southern Railway—Chennai Egmore, Katpadi, Madurai, Rameswaram and Kanniyakumari— which is estimated to cost about ₹1,803 crore. As per the Railways, these stations would sport upgraded passenger amenities, aesthetically designed interiors, improved ambience, beautiful landscaping in the frontage, inter-model access, airport-like illumination and parking facilities.  ""Futuristic world-class amenities that will come up at the redeveloped stations will meet requirements of the next 40 years,"" it said. The Prime Minister also inaugurated the Madurai-Theni gauge converted railway line, which costs ₹506 crore. He also flagged off the inaugural passenger train service between the Madurai-Theni Section. ""Passenger train service between Madurai and Theni is planned to be introduced shortly. Approval for operation of train services has been already received from the Railway Board. This train will stop at Vadapalani, Usilampatti and Andipatti stations. On completion of the line up to Bodinayakkanur, additional train services will be planned,"" the Railways said.  The ₹598-crore Tambaram-Chengalpattu third line project, work on which was commenced during January 2017, was also dedicated to the nation by the Prime Minister.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicated to the nation and laid the foundation stone for 11 infrastructure projects worth about ?31,530 crore in Tamil Nadu .

5,"Rising to the occasion, Indian men's hockey team slammed six goals in the final quarter for a crushing 16-0 victory against Indonesia, a result that took the holders into the knockout stage of the Asia Cup but shut the World Cup door on Pakistan, in Jakarta on Thursday. India needed to win the Pool A contest by at least a 15-0 margin to qualify and the young players of the side delivered under pressure. Both India and Pakistan finished on four points each in Pool A behind Japan but the defending champions qualified for the Super 4s due to better goal difference (1). Pakistan had lost 2-3 to Japan earlier in the day. The result not only pushed Pakistan out of the tournament but also dashed their hopes of World Cup qualification since only the top three teams here will be given tickets for the big event. India, being the hosts, will play the World Cup later in the year and hence Hockey India decided to send young players to this tournament for exposure. Dipsan Tirkey (5 goals) and Sudev Belimagga (3 goal) shared eight goals between them, playing a key role in team's crucial win. Veteran SV Sunil, Pawan Rajbhar and Karthi Selvam scored a brace each while Uttam Singh and Nilam Sanjeep Xess were the other goal getters for India. With odds stacked against them, India started on an attacking note and had the first shy at the goal in the seventh minute but Uttam Singh, who had only the goalkeeper to beat, pushed wide Maninder Singh's feed . In the 10th minute, Rajbhar broke the shackles with a powerful shot from top of the circle. Rajbhar doubled India's lead a minute later through a rebound from the team's first penalty corner. A minute from the first quarter, India extended their lead through Uttam, who was at the right place at the right time to tap home. India continued their attacking instinct and secured another penalty corner in the 19th minute from which Sunil scored after they recovered from a miss-stop. A minute later, the Indians earned back-to-back penalty corners, the second of which was converted by Nilam Sanjeep Xess to make the scoreline 5-0. In the 24th minute, Sunil deflected in Karthi Selvam's pass from near post to make it 6-0. After the change of ends, Uttam missed yet another chance as she shot wide from close range with only the Indonesian goalie to beat. Minutes later, India secured their seventh penalty corner but Junius Rumaropen made a double save once again. In the 40th minute, Selvam tapped in after he was set by a brilliant Rajbhar, who dodged past three-four Indonesian defenders with his stickwork and strong play. India secured three consecutive penalty corners and Dipsan scored from the last to keep the team's hopes alive. Dipsan scored his second from the penalty stroke in the 42nd minute. The Indians managed two more penalty corners but on both the occasion Dipsan faltered. Belimagga then scored two goals in a span of two minutes before Dipsan completed his hat-trick by converting India's 14th penalty corner to make the scoreline 12-0. The Indians earned a handful of penalty corners thereafter but the chances went abegging. Tirkey then converted a penalty corner in the 47th minute before Sudev scored from a rebound from another set piece, five minutes from the hooter. Desperate for goals, the Indians attacked with numbers and their ploy bore fruit when Karthi Selvam scored from a field effort. Tirkey converted two more penalty corners in the final minute of the game to extend India's stay in the tournament.",Dipsan Tirkey (5 goals) and Sudev Belimagga (3 goals) shared eight goals between them in 16-0 win .

7," The Centre maintained on Wednesday that the festival season starting from October and the commitment to stabilise prices in the domestic market were the reasons for restricting sugar exports beyond 10 million tonnes (100 lakh metric tonnes).  The farmers, however, were suspicious of the decision and said the Centre was closing all avenues for better prices for what they produce.  Talking to reporters, Department of Food and Public Distribution Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said the Centre's first priority was to ensure sufficient availability of sugar for consumption at a reasonable rate, and thereafter divert more sugar into ethanol production. ""During the festival period of October and November, the demand for sugar increases and therefore, the Centre is committed to ensure availability of sugar for the lean period,"" Mr. Pandey said. The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) had issued an order on Tuesday stating that the export of sugar would be allowed with specific permission from the Directorate of Sugar, Department of Food and Public Distribution between June 1 and October 31, or till further order, whichever is earlier. Mr. Pandey said the Department would release Export Release Orders (EROs) on receiving applications from sugar mills and exporters. ""Sugar mills will apply for ERO for dispatch of sugar from mills for export. Exporters will apply for export of sugar out of country. Both need to apply online through National Single Window System (NSWS),"" he added. He said the Centre was committed to stabilising the price of sugar in the domestic market and in past 12 months, the price had been under control. ""Wholesale prices of sugar in India are range bound between ₹3,150-₹3,500 per quintal while retail prices are also within control in the range of ₹36- ₹44 in different parts of the country. Global situation reflects a shortage of sugar, especially due to lower production in Brazil. This may trigger the demand globally and so as to safeguard domestic availability and interests, DGFT issued an order to maintain domestic availability and price stability of sugar in the country during sugar season 2021-22 (October-September),"" he said.  The move has irked farmers' groups. ""The direct impact of this decision is not on sugar price but on the farmers. The traders will take it as a pretext to reduce the cost they pay to farmers. The government recently announced such decisions on wheat, sugar and onion. The message is clear that the Centre will not reduce prices of petrol or diesel to control inflation, but farmers will have to shoulder the burden of inflation. These decisions also expose the stand taken by pro-neoliberal groups that this government brought three farm laws to encourage exports. But it has now been proved that this government is taking pro-corporate stand, not pro-farmer stand,"" Ajit Nawale, general secretary of the Maharashtra unit of the All India Kisan Sabha, said.  He said there was excess sugar cane production in Maharashtra and the sugar mills were struggling to complete crushing. ""Farmers are yet to complete harvest. Both sugar mills and farmers will be in trouble because of the restrictions on sugar export,"" Mr. Nawale said.  Jitender Singh Hudda, a farmers' leader from Shamli in Western Uttar Pradesh, said farmers got a better price for sugar cane after several years due to exports. ""We were told that there is enough sugar stock in the country. The next crushing season would have started in October after four months. This government is closing all opportunities for farmers. We would have got access to more markets and better prices because of the international situation. The sugar production is regularly surplus. They should have looked at the cultivate area before imposing restrictions. Monsoon reports were also normal. The quota release system is already there for sugar mills. So domestic markets wouldn't have impacted at all,"" Mr. Hudda said. ","Centre says festival season starting from October and commitment to stabilise prices in domestic market are reasons for restricting sugar exports beyond 10 million tonnes (100 lakh metric tonnes) The farmers, however, were suspicious of the decision and said the Centre was closing all avenues for better prices for what they produce .

8,"Ferdinand Marcos Jr. was proclaimed the next President of the Philippines by a joint session of Congress on Wednesday following a landslide election triumph 36 years after his dictator father was ousted in a pro-democracy uprising. The Senate and House of Representatives also declared that his separately elected vice presidential running mate, Sara Duterte, had won by a wide margin. She is the daughter of outgoing President Rodrigo Duterte, whose turbulent six-year term ends on June 30. They will lead a nation battered by COVID-19 lockdowns, crushing poverty, gaping inequality, Muslim and communist insurgencies, crime and political divisions further inflamed by the May 9 election. With his 92-year-old mother, Imelda Marcos, his wife, family and siblings beside him, Mr. Marcos Jr.'s hands were raised by the Senate president and House speaker in a plenary hall bedecked with a huge Philippine flag to applause from the audience, which included diplomats. ""I'm humbled,"" he later told reporters. ""I thank our people and, beyond that, I promise you that we may not be perfect but we will always strive to perfection."" ""I ask you all pray for me, wish me well. I want to do well because when the President does well, the country does well,"" he said, without taking any questions. Mr. Marcos Jr., a 64-year-old former governor, congressman and senator, has refused to acknowledge or apologise for massive human rights violations and plunder under his father's rule and has defended his legacy.  When they take office, Mr. Marcos Jr. and Sara Duterte will likely face demands to prosecute her father over thousands of killings of mostly poor suspects under his yearslong crackdown on illegal drugs. The deaths are currently under investigation by the International Criminal Court. Mr. Marcos Jr. received more than 31 million votes and Sara Duterte more than 32 million out of more than 55 million votes cast in the election. It was the first majority presidential victory in the Asian democracy in decades.  During the campaign, they avoided controversial issues and focused on a call for national unity, although their fathers' presidencies opened some of the most volatile divisions in the country's history. Mr. Marcos Jr. appealed to be judged ""not by my ancestors, but by my actions."" Sen. Imee Marcos, his sister, thanked those who voted for him after what she described as decades of ""ridicule and oppression."" ""We're very, very grateful for a second chance,"" she told reporters before the proclamation. ""Our family went through a lot and after 1986, we faced all sorts of cases, ridicule and oppression"" for nearly four decades.  In Mr. Marcos Jr.'s campaign headquarters, supporters waved Philippine flags, flashed the victory sign and held a streamer congratulating him and Sara Duterte. Still, both have been hounded by their fathers' reputations. Riot police used a water cannon and shields to prevent a few hundred activists from marching to Congress to oppose Wednesday's proclamations, injuring at least 14 protesters, the left-wing group Bayan said. ""Ferdinand Sr. tortured a lot of people, many were killed and many are still missing up to now. There is no justice for their families. Many starved and that was also the same in Mr. Duterte's period,"" protester Mimi Domingo said. Last week, human rights activists submitted a petition to the Supreme Court against Mr. Marcos Jr.'s eligibility, citing his past tax conviction. They asked the court to block his proclamation, but no such order was issued. The complaint was earlier dismissed by the Commission on Elections. His father was forced from power by a largely peaceful ""People Power"" uprising in 1986 and died in 1989 while in exile in Hawaii without admitting any wrongdoing, including accusations that he, his family and cronies amassed an estimated $5 billion to $10 billion while he was in power. A Hawaii court later found him liable for human rights violations and awarded $2 billion from his estate to compensate more than 9,000 Filipinos who filed a lawsuit against him for torture, incarceration, extrajudicial killings and disappearances. Imelda Marcos and her children were allowed to return to the Philippines in 1991 and worked on a stunning political comeback, helped by a well-funded social media campaign to refurbish the family name. Along metropolitan Manila's main avenue, democracy shrines and monuments erected after Marcos' downfall stand prominently. The anniversary of his ouster is celebrated each year as a special national holiday, and a presidential commission that has worked for decades to recover ill-gotten wealth still exists. Mr. Marcos Jr. has not explained how he will deal with such remainders of the past. ""What happens to all the monuments that commemorate all those lives lost? What happens to all those monuments that celebrate our collective victories?"" asked Pio Abad, a Filipino artist who opened an art exhibit last month focusing on the extravagant lifestyle of the Marcoses when they were in power amid the country's appalling poverty. ""History is at stake and that is probably, for me, one of the largest things at risk,"" said Abad, whose activist father was detained after the dictator imposed martial law in 1972.","Ferdinand Marcos Jr. declared next President of the Philippines by a joint session of Congress .

South Korea's top conglomerate said on Tuesday the investments through 2026 are expected to help Samsung drive long-term growth in strategic areas such as the chip sector, while pledging aggressive investments in the biopharmaceutical sector to make it as successful as its chip business. Samsung Electronics, the world's largest memory chip maker, did not provide a breakdown of the figures, though it added that 80% of investments will be made in South Korea and that Tuesday's announcement includes a 240 trillion won investment pledge made in August 2021. Samsung did not include electric vehicle batteries as a future growth engine in the announcement. Samsung SDI, the group's battery unit, and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, are scheduled to announce their new battery plant in the U.S. state of Indiana on Tuesday. Securing domestic chip and bio supply chains will have strategic significance and be important for South Korea's economic security, Samsung said in the announcement. The 450 trillion won investments, expected to create 1.07 million jobs, are over 30% greater than the 330 trillion won Samsung invested in the five years to 2021.","Samsung Group will invest 450 trillion won ($356 billion) in the next five years to accelerate growth in semiconductors, biopharmaceutical and other next-generation technologies .

In the last reel posted on Instagram, she had dedicated a song to her mother. Kashmir has seen a rise in targeted killings this month. Three policemen and two civilians, including a Kashmiri Pandit employee, were among those killed in militant attacks in May. Parties in Jammu and Kashmir have condemned the killing of the artist. ""Shocked and deeply saddened by the murderous militant attack on Bhat. Sadly, she lost her life in the attack and her nephew was injured.

12,"Ending days of speculation over its choice of candidates for two Rajya Sabha seats, the AIADMK, on Wednesday night, nominated former Law Minister, C.Ve. Shanmugam and the party's former Ramanathapuram district secretary R. Dharmar for the seats.  This was announced by O. Panneerselvam, coordinator, and Edappadi K. Palaniswami, co-coordinator in a release.  Earlier, deputy coordinators, K.P. Munusamy and R. Vaithilingam held a nearly three hour-long discussion at the residence of Mr. Panneerselvam in the city.  While Mr. Shamugam, also the AIADMK's Villupuram district secretary, belongs to the Vanniyar community, Mr. Dharmar is from the Maravar sub-sect of Mukkolathors.  The former Law Minister has been with the camp led by Edappadi K. Palaniswami and looking after legal issues concerning the party.  Mr. Dharmar held the post of Ramanathapuram district secretary in 2016, before he was replaced with former IT Minister M. Manikandan. At present, he is the chairperson of Mudukulathur panchayat union, besides being the secretary of the panchayat union unit of the party.   One factor that clinched in his favour was that he was instrumental in organising a meeting in his district for Mr. Panneerselvam, when the AIADMK coordinator undertook the ""Dharma Yudham'' campaign in 2017.  By choosing the two persons, the party maintained a balance between regions and communities, says a senior leader. Several names were doing rounds in the last couple of weeks and they included former Ministers S. Semmalai, D. Jayakumar B. Valarmathi and R. Gokula Indira; Madurai's former Member of Parliament, R. Gopalakrishnan and former legislator J.C.D. Prabhakar.  Last week, a meeting was held with senior members and functionaries to discuss the names, in which the party leadership was authorised to finalise the candidates.  ",Former Law Minister C.Ve.

13,"Common air pollutants, such as small particulate matter and ground-level ozone, are associated with more severe outcomes after COVID-19 infection, including admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), according to a study. The research, published on May 24 in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, analysed data on 1,51,105 people aged 20 years and older with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in 2020 in Ontario, Canada, not living in a long-term care facility. The researchers modelled historical exposure to three common air pollutants before the pandemic - fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ground-level ozone (O3). They adjusted for date of diagnosis, sex and age, being part of an outbreak, essential worker status, neighbourhood socioeconomic status, health care access including previous influenza vaccination history, previous outpatient visits and other factors. The study identified 8,630, 1,912 and 2,137 COVID-19-related hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and deaths, respectively. The median times between first diagnosis and hospital admission, ICU admission and death were 5 days, 8 days and 15 days, respectively, the researchers said. ""We observed that people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who lived in areas of Ontario with higher levels of common air pollutants were at elevated risk of being admitted to the ICU after we adjusted for individual and contextual confounding factors, even when the air pollution level was relatively low,"" said Hong Chen from Health Canada, the department of the Government of Canada. The researchers also found an elevated risk of hospitalisation with chronic exposure to PM2.5 and O3, and an increased risk of death from COVID-19 with chronic exposure to O3. These results add to the growing reports linking air pollution to COVID-19 severity from other countries, including Spain and Mexico, they said.  ""Given the ongoing pandemic, our findings that underscore the link between chronic exposure to air pollution and more severe COVID-19 could have important implications for public health and health systems,"" the authors of the study noted.  They call for more research to find the mechanisms of how long-term exposure to air pollution may be influencing severity of COVID-19.

14," Manchester City clinched a sixth Premier League title in 11 seasons on Sunday by scoring three times in five minutes to come from behind to beat Aston Villa 3-2 in the finale to avoid being toppled by challenger Liverpool. City was trailing 2-0 to Villa until İlkay Gündoğan began the comeback in the 76th. Rodri equalized two minutes later and Gündoğan put City in front in the 81st. At one point even when City was losing, it was still set to defend the title as Liverpool was only drawing 1-1 to Wolverhampton. But Mohamed Salah then put the second-place side in front in the 84th minute, which would have taken Liverpool into first place had City not mounted its fightback at the Etihad Stadium. Andy Robertson then sealed Liverpool's 3-1 win. Had City conceded a late equalizer, Liverpool would have snatched the trophy away but Pep Guardiola's side held on for the win in a thrilling climax. Liverpool's bid for an unprecedented quadruple of major trophies ended in agonizing fashion on Sunday despite coming from behind to beat Wolverhampton 3-1 on the final day of the Premier League. Jurgen Klopp's team also needed Manchester City to drop points against Aston Villa — managed by Liverpool great Steven Gerrard — and the leaders recovered from two goals down to win 3-2 in a dramatic finale at Etihad Stadium. Liverpool finished a point behind City — just like in the 2018-19 season — and missed out on a record-tying 20th English league championship. It is still an extraordinary season for Liverpool, which has won both the FA Cup and League Cup and will play in the Champions League final against Real Madrid next weekend. Pedro Neto gave Wolves the lead in the third minute after Liverpool defender Ibrahima Konaté misjudged a long ball forward, allowing Raul Jimenez to run through and cross for Neto to tap in. Sadio Mane equalized in the 24th, and Liverpool wound up fulfilling its part of the final-day bargain by scoring through Mohamed Salah and Andrew Robertson in the final six minutes.","Manchester City came from behind to beat Aston Villa 3-2 in the finale to avoid being toppled by challenger Liverpool .

15,"Punjab Kings outclassed Sunrisers Hyderabad by five wickets in the last IPL group stage fixture at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday. PBKS took the sixth spot, while SRH — with six losses in its last seven outings — finished eighth. Chasing 158, Kings cruised home on the back of an explosive knock from Liam Livingstone (49 n.o., 22b, 2x4, 5x6). The Englishman's assault on the express Umran Malik provided exciting fare. With sixes over extra-cover and mid-wicket, Livingstone clearly won this battle. Opener Jonny Bairstow received a life when Umran put down an absolute sitter. The damage was minimal, however, as the Englishman was cleaned up by Afghanistan fast bowler Fazalhaq Farooqi soon after. The England batter engaged in some verbal jousting with the opponents as he walked off the park. After electing to bat, Sunrisers struggled to find rhythm and finished with a sub-par total. Left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar broke the back of the Hyderabad batting with three wickets. Rahul Tripathi (20, 18b, 1x4, 1x6) was his first victim, a mistimed sweep finding Dhawan at short fine-leg. Abhishek Sharma (43, 32b, 5x4, 2x6) was taken well by Livingstone at long-on. Harpreet saved his best for South African Aiden Markram (21, 17b, 2x4), drawing him out with flight and beating the bat with turn. Harpreet, who recorded his best figures for this season, proved his worth by dismissing three settled batters. Washington Sundar (25, 19b, 3x4, 1x6) and Romario Shepherd (26, 15b, 2x4, 2x6) put on 58 runs for the sixth wicket.

16," President Joe Biden said Sunday that recent cases of monkeypox that have been identified in Europe and the United States were something ""to be concerned about."" In his first public comments on the disease, Biden added: ""It is a concern in that if it were to spread it would be consequential."" The president was asked about the disease as he spoke to reporters at Osan Air Base in South Korea, where he visited troops before taking off for Japan to continue his first trip to Asia as president. ""They haven't told me the level of exposure yet but it is something that everybody should be concerned about,"" Biden said. He added that work was underway to determine what vaccine might be effective. Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser, told reporters aboard the flight to Tokyo that the United States has a supply of ""vaccine that is relevant to treating monkeypox."" ""We have vaccine available to be deployed for that purpose,"" he said. Sullivan said Biden was getting regular updates on the outbreak. Monkeypox is rarely identified outside of Africa, but as of Friday, there were 80 confirmed cases worldwide, including at least two in the United States, and another 50 suspected ones. Although the disease belongs to the same virus family as smallpox, its symptoms are milder. People usually recover within two to four weeks without needing to be hospitalized, but the disease occasionally is deadly.","""It is a concern in that if it were to spread it would be consequential,"" Biden says .

17," A leopard was allegedly killed by residents of Nabi Nagar village, following which the forest department decided to lodge an FIR against them, officials said on Sunday.

The animal died on its way to the veterinary hospital after being rescued by a forest department team. Officials had initially claimed that there was no external injury on the carcass. ""Post-mortem has confirmed that the animal was very weak and had internal injuries due to actions of the villagers. They also chased the animal and tied its feet which further deteriorated its health condition and resulted in its death,"" Mr. Singh said. ""As many as two dozen villagers were involved in attacking the leopard and chasing it. An FIR under relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act will be lodged against the accused,"" he added. Last month the Forest Department lodged FIR against 64 villagers for attacking and killing a leopard. The villagers also attacked the forest team then.

19,"The government is considering spending an additional ₹2 lakh crore ($26 billion) in the 2022-23 fiscal year to cushion consumers from rising prices and fight multi-year high inflation, two government officials told Reuters. The new measures will be double the ₹1 lakh crore hit government revenues could take from tax cuts on petrol and diesel the Finance Minister announced on May 21, both the officials said. Retail inflation rose to an eight-year high in April, while wholesale inflation rose to at least a 17-year high, posing a major headache for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government ahead of elections to several State Assemblies in 2022. ""We are fully focussed on bringing down inflation. The impact of Ukraine crisis was worse than anyone's imagination,"" one official, who did not want to be named, said. The government estimates another ₹500 billion additional funds will be needed to subsidise fertilizers, from the current estimate of ₹2.15 lakh crore, the two officials said. The government could also deliver another round of tax cuts on petrol and diesel if crude oil continues to rise that could mean an added hit of ₹1 lakh crore-₹1.5 lakh crore in the 2022/23 fiscal year started on April 1, the second official said. Both the officials did not want to be named as they are not authorised to disclose the details. The government did not immediately comment outside office hours. One of the officials said the government may need to borrow additional sums from the market to fund these measures and that could mean a slippage from the its deficit target of 6.4% of GDP for 2022-23. The official did not quantify the amount of borrowing or fiscal slippage saying it depended on how much funds they eventually divert from the budget in the fiscal year. The government plans to borrow a record ₹14.31 lakh crore in the current fiscal year, according to budget announcements made in February. The other official said the additional borrowing will not impact the planned April-September borrowing of ₹8.45 lakh crore and may be undertaken in January-March 2023.","The government may need to borrow additional sums from the market to fund these measures .

20,"Blame it on lack of parental attention or active social learning, two boys aged under 15 are now subjects of investigation for what they allegedly did: coaxed two other children in their neighbourhood into stealing from home. And it was not just a case of 'disappearing' pencils or erasers but a 'whopping' ₹4 lakh cash in a matter of about three weeks. Jeedimetla police on Saturday pressed charges of theft against two minors, aged 13 and 14, and are investigating the events that led to the crime. A special juvenile police unit would initiate procedures as per the Juvenile Justice Act soon, police said. According to Jeedimetla police, the complaint was lodged by a family at SR Naik Nagar on Friday, which stated that ₹4 lakh went missing from their house and was replaced by 'Children Bank of India' fake money notes. An elaborate probe revealed that their two sons, aged about 10 years, were influenced by the two boys living next door, to steal the money. It all began about three weeks ago when the boys discussed among themselves about their parents safekeeping the money in a cupboard. Their parents and the police were shocked when they saw the recovered property purchased by the stolen amount. Smart watches, cellphones, earphones, among other electronic products, were found by the police. The boys had also been to restaurants, gaming and entertainment centres. A thorough investigation is underway.","Jeedimetla police pressed charges of theft against two minors, aged 13 and 14, and are investigating the events that led to the crime .

21," U.S. President Joe Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said after meeting Saturday that they will consider expanded joint military exercises to deter the nuclear threat from North Korea at a time when there's little hope of real diplomacy on the matter. The announcement reflects a shift in direction by both leaders from their predecessors: Former U.S. President Donald Trump had considered scrapping the exercises and expressed affection for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. And the last South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, remained committed to dialogue with Kim to the end of his term despite being repeatedly rebuffed by the North. Biden said cooperation between the U.S. and South Korea shows ""our readiness to take on all threats together."" North Korea, which has defended its nuclear weapons and missile development as a necessary deterrence against what it describes as U.S. threats, could well respond angrily to Saturday's announcement. It has long described joint military exercises as rehearsals for an invasion, although the allies have portrayed the drills as defensive. Biden and Yoon affirmed in remarks at a joint news conference that their shared goal is the complete denuclearization of North Korea. The U.S. and South Korea said in a joint statement that they were committed to a ""rules-based international order"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The statement likely sets the stage for how the U.S. and its allies will address any challenges with North Korea. Yet Biden also reiterated his offer of vaccines to North Korea as the coronavirus spreads at a dangerously fast speed through that country, including an offer to route them through China if that was more acceptable to North Korea. Asked if he would be willing to meet with Kim Jong Un, Biden said that would depend on whether the North Korean leader was ""sincere"" and ""serious."" ""Yes, we've offered vaccines, not only to North Korea but China as well,"" Biden said. ""We're prepared to do that immediately. We've gotten no response."" The division of the Korean Peninsula after World War II has led to two radically different countries. In South Korea, Biden is touring factories for computer chips and next-generation autos in a democracy and engaging in talks for greater cooperation. But in the North, there is a deadly coronavirus outbreak in a largely unvaccinated autocracy that can best command the world's attention by flexing its nuclear capabilities. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One as Biden flew to South Korea, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S. has coordinated with Seoul and Tokyo on how they'll respond should the North conduct a nuclear test or missile strike while Biden is in the region or soon after.

22,"A substance found in fruits and vegetables can neutralise the venom of a poisonous pit viper common in much of South America, Brazilian researchers have discovered. In Brazil, the Bothrops jararaca, also called ""yarara,"" is responsible for most of the country's 26,000 recorded snake bites each year, according to the online Reptile Database. The study, conducted by Sao Paulo's Butantan Institute and published in the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology, found that a modified version of the compound rutin, the water soluble succinyl rutin, can delay the effect of a poisonous bite. The finding could complement standard treatment with anti-bothropic serum, offering an emergency fix for those bitten in remote locations where immediate access to medical services is impossible. Marcelo Santoro, who coordinated the research, said the serum treats the main effects of the snakebite. ""In this sense, rutin would serve as an adjuvant; not to replace the serum, but to delay the effects of poisoning, controlling bleeding and inflammation,"" he said.","In Brazil, the Bothrops jararaca is responsible for most of the country's 26,000 recorded snake bites each year .

23," Women presenters on Afghanistan's leading TV channels went on air Saturday without covering their faces, defying a Taliban order that they conceal their appearance to comply with the group's austere brand of Islam. Since surging back to power last year the Taliban have imposed a slew of restrictions on civil society, many focused on reining in the rights of women and girls. Earlier this month Afghanistan's supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada issued a diktat for women to cover up fully in public, including their faces, ideally with the traditional burqa. The feared Ministry for Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice ordered women TV presenters to follow suit by Saturday. Previously they had only been required to wear a headscarf. But broadcasters TOLOnews, Shamshad TV and 1TV all aired live programmes Saturday with women presenters' faces visible. ""Our female colleagues are concerned that if they cover their faces, the next thing they will be told is to stop working,"" said Shamshad TV head of news Abid Ehsas. ""This is the reason they have not observed the order so far,"" he told AFP, adding the channel had requested further discussions with the Taliban on the issue. Taliban orders such as this have caused many female journalists to leave Afghanistan since the hardline Islamists stormed back to power, a woman presenter said. ""Their latest order has broken the hearts of women presenters and many now think they have no future in this country,"" she said, requesting not to be named. ""I'm thinking of leaving the country. Decrees like this will force many professionals to leave.""","Women presenters on Afghanistan's leading TV channels go on air without covering their faces .

24,"The remarks made by Delhi University Associate Professor Ratan Lal, though ""avoidable"" and ""reprehensible"", ""do not indicate an attempt to promote hatred between communities"", a local court in Delhi observed on Saturday while granting him bail a day after he was arrested by Delhi Police. The 50-year-old history teacher at DU's Hindu College was arrested shortly after he was called in for questioning on Friday. The police said they had booked him on a complaint from an advocate, who said that Mr. Lal's social media post on the Gyanvapi mosque issue had hurt the sentiments of the Hindu community.  In addition to teaching at DU, Mr. Lal runs a YouTube channel called Ambedkarnama, where he discusses and critiques government policies.  While granting him bail on a personal bond of ₹50,000 and one surety of the like amount, Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Siddhartha Malik of the Tis Hazari court said, ""The feeling of hurt felt by an individual cannot represent the entire group or community and any such complaint regarding hurt feelings has to be seen in its context considering the entire spectrum of facts/circumstances."" Noting that the same remarks can elicit different feelings in different people, Mr. Malik said that while he, as a ""proud"" Hindu, would call Mr. Lal's post ""distasteful"" and ""unnecessary"", others might find it shameful or feel sorry for the accused but not find it inciting hatred or enraging.  The court said, ""India is a country of more than 130 crore people and any subject can have 130 crore different views and perceptions."" While arguing his case, counsel appearing for Mr. Lal submitted before the court that his arrest was an example of abuse of law. They argued that as a reputed associate professor of history, Mr. Lal had written an academic post on the disputed structure alleged to have been found at the Gyanvapi mosque in Uttar Pradesh.  The trial court also noted the disputed nature of the structure and added, ""the photographs used in the post are themselves not verified to be belonging to any specific proceedings as the controversy relates to a report which is still not in public domain"". Mr. Lal's lawyers added that since it did not incite any feelings of hatred nor did it incite any kind of violence, the post does not even meet the ingredients required to make out offences under Sections 153A (promoting enmity on grounds of religion, race, etc.) and 295A (deliberate act with intent to insult religious feelings) of the IPC.  They also added that Mr. Lal himself was a Hindu, and did not seek to create any animosity between religious groups and that he did not intend to hurt the religious feeling of any person or group.  The court was packed with advocates on Saturday, with about 20 lawyers arguing on different points of law for the history teacher, who was produced in court at 3.30 p.m. by the Delhi police.  Despite not wanting his custody for the investigation, the police on Saturday opposed Mr. Lal's bail application and sought that he be sent to judicial custody. They argued that allowing him bail would send ""a wrong message to society"".  Additional Public Prosecutor Atul Kumar Srivastava and Additional PP Salil Maheshwari, for the State, said his social media post was ""clearly meant to incite hatred between religious groups"" and that he had defended his statements in the media repeatedly.  Mr. Malik said the ""anxiety of the police can be understood"" given its duty to maintain law and order.  But he added, ""The court has to employ higher standards while considering the need to send a person to custody... accused is a person of good repute with no criminal antecedent and there is no likelihood of the accused fleeing... in view of the aforesaid, the court sees no need to send the accused to judicial custody."" And even as the court said that Mr. Lal's post appeared to be a ""failed attempt at satire... that backfired"", it restricted him ""from posting any social media posts or interviews regarding the controversy which resulted in the present FIR"". After the court noted that all necessary bail formalities had been completed, it directed the police to release him. Mr. Lal was then released from the Maurice Nagar police station around 5 p.m. and dropped home by the police, his lawyers said. The issue of law enforcement authorities cracking down on instances of people exercising their right to free speech came up again on Saturday in Mr. Lal's case, a week after the Supreme Court put the sedition law (Section 124A of IPC) on hold. The top court has also directed that no new FIRs be registered under Section 124A while the Union government reconsiders it. However, the SC directive to put sedition law on hold has not deterred police forces across States from slapping other sections to book people. Mr. Lal has been charged under Section 153A and 295A of the IPC.  In Maharashtra, on Saturday morning, Section 295 (defiling place of worship with intent to insult religion) of the IPC was also invoked by the Pune Police to book dancer Vaishnavi Patil and two others for filming a lavani (folk dance) performance inside the city's Lal Mahal which is associated with Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Section 295A of the IPC was also used to book stand-up comedian Munawar Faruqui and arrest him for a joke he had written last year.

25,"The government has waived customs duty on the import of some raw materials, including coking coal and ferronickel, used by the steel industry, a move which will lower the cost for the domestic industry and reduce prices. Also, to increase domestic availability, the duty on exports of iron ore has been raised up to 50%, and that for a few steel intermediaries to 15%, according to a notification. The duty changes will be effective from Sunday. The import duty on ferronickel, coking coal, PCI coal has been cut from 2.5%, while the duty on coke and semi-coke has been slashed from 5% to 'nil'. The tax on the export of iron ores and concentrates has been increased to 50%, from 30%, while for iron pellets, a 45% duty has been imposed.    ""This will result in reduction of cost of final products,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted. AMRG & Associates senior partner Rajat Mohan said steep reduction in import duty on these products would help arrest high inflation.

26,"Even as no case of monkey pox, a close cousin of small pox which shows up as fever, body ache and very distinct skin lesions, is yet to be reported in the country, the State Health department has sounded a general alert on the disease. The Health department convened a meeting and sounded an alert on monkey pox to districts, following an advisory of the Union Health Ministry. The latter issued the alert as monkey pox seemed to have spread from many countries in Europe to the U.S. in the past few days, with cases being brought in through international travel. ""We have sounded a general alert to districts to augment disease surveillance and to be alert in the field as to any unusual disease presentations. The disease seems to have been imported to all nations in the West through international travel and as a State with four international airports and good tourist traffic, Kerala needs to be on guard against all new diseases. However, as of now, the Union Health Ministry has not issued any directions regarding airport surveillance by States,"" a senior Health official said. The Centre has, however, initiated surveillance of international airport arrivals and Health officials have been asked to watch out for any symptoms (fever, chills, body ache, lesions on skin) in passengers and to isolate them. The blood samples are to be sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune. Monkey pox causes many general symptoms of flu, including fever and headache. But the disease is often distinguished by the lesions that appear on the face a few days after fever, and which spreads to the body, especially the palms. The incubation period for the disease - the time from exposure to the virus to then manifestation of symptoms - ranges from five to 21 days. Transmission happens only through close contact and by touching or sharing the clothes or bedding used by the patient, because the lesions are full of viruses. Transmission can last throughout the course of the illness, till the lesions heal. As monkey pox is closely related to small pox, the only virus to have been eradicated from the world in 1980, respiratory transmission through saliva droplets is a significant possibility. The disease has been confined largely to Central and West Africa and the only time it was reported outside of Africa was in 2003, when 47 confirmed and probable cases were reported in six States in the U.S. The outbreak was linked to infected exotic pets imported from Ghana, which in turn infected some prairie dogs sold as pets, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Small pox vaccinations were wound up in the 1970s and the virus was declared eradicated in 1980. CDC scientists have suggested that the time that has lapsed after small pox eradication and the lack of inoculation might have weakened the immunity of subsequent generations to this virus. With over 100 cases reported in 11 countries outside Africa in the past few weeks alone, scientists are looking at reasons for the rapid spread, Nature has reported. Preliminary genetic data indicates that the circulating strain is predominantly found in Western Africa and that it causes a milder disease. However, it was not yet clear if all the cases reported now are related or if it can be traced to a single origin, it said.","State Health Department has sounded a general alert on monkey pox to districts .

(Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today's Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) On new iPhones ""wireless chips can no longer be trusted to be turned off after shutdown,"" according to researchers at Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany. These wireless chips enable the phone to run on Low-Power Mode (LPM) to locate lost devices using the Find My feature. LPM is either activated when the user switches off their phone or when iOS shuts down automatically due to low battery. And as the power saving mode is set at the iPhone's hardware level, the feature cannot be removed with system updates. So, it has a long-lasting effect on the overall iOS security model, the researchers note. Newer iPhones are Bluetooth-, Near Field Communication (NFC)-, and Ultra-wideband (UWB)-enabled, keeping them on even after power runs out.

28,"The Google search engine collects data on users who think they can be anonymous if they use a ""private browsing"" mode, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton claimed on Thursday, filing an amended privacy lawsuit against the Alphabet Inc unit. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today's Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Incognito mode or ""private browsing"" is a web browser function that Paxton said implies Google will not track search history or location activity. The lawsuit said Google offers the option of ""private browsing"" that could include ""viewing highly personal websites that might indicate, for example, their medical history, political persuasion, or sexual orientation. Or maybe they simply want to buy a surprise gift without the gift recipient being tipped off by a barrage of targeted ads.""

29,"The past seven years were the warmest on record, and 2021 did not see record-breaking temperatures because of a La Niña event at the start and end of the year, according to a report by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) on Wednesday.  La Nina is a cooling of surface temperatures in the Central Pacific. While this had a temporary cooling effect, it did not reverse the overall trend of rising temperatures. The average global temperature in 2021 was about 1.11 (± 0.13) °C above the pre-industrial level. The report comes even as north, central and western India reel under an onslaught of pre-monsoon heat waves, with temperatures in March breaching century-old records. Four key climate change indicators — greenhouse gas concentrations, sea level rise, ocean heat and ocean acidification — set new records in 2021, according to the report. Extreme weather led to economic damage worth hundreds of billions of dollars and triggered shocks for food, water security and displacement that worsened in 2022. ""Renewables are the only path to real energy security, stable power prices and sustainable employment opportunities. If we act together, the renewable energy transformation can be the peace project of the 21st century,"" said Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations. The world must act in this decade to prevent ever worsening climate impacts and to keep temperature increase to below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, he said. ""It is just a matter of time before we see another warmest year on record,"" said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas. ""Our climate is changing before our eyes. The heat trapped by human-induced greenhouse gases will warm the planet for many generations to come. Sea level rise, ocean heat and acidification will continue for hundreds of years, unless means to remove carbon from the atmosphere are invented. Some glaciers have reached the point of no return and this will have long-term repercussions in a world in which more than 2 billion people already experience water stress."" The WMO report added that ocean surface temperatures were at a record high. The upper 2000m depth of the ocean continued to warm in 2021 and would continue to do so in the future — a change which is irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales. The scientific consensus was that ocean warming rates have shown a particularly strong increase in the past two decades and this warmth was penetrating to ever deeper levels."," The average global temperature in 2021 was about 1.11 (± 0.13) °C above the pre-industrial level .

30,"India will not change upcoming cybersecurity rules that force social media, technology companies and cloud service providers to report data breaches swiftly, despite growing industry concerns, the government said on Wednesday. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today's Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team issued a directive in April asking tech companies to report data breaches within six hours of ""noticing such incidents"" and to maintain IT and communications logs for six months. They also mandated cloud service providers such as Amazon and virtual private network (VPN) companies to retain names of their customers and IP addresses for at least five years, even after they stop using the company's services. The measures have raised concerns within the industry about a growing compliance burden and higher costs. India's junior IT minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar said there will be no changes despite the worries, saying tech companies have an obligation to know who is using their services. India has tightened regulation of Big Tech firms in recent years, prompting pushback from the industry and in some cases even straining trade ties between New Delhi and Washington. New Delhi has said the new rules were needed as cybersecurity incidents were reported regularly but the requisite information needed to investigate them was not always readily available from the service providers. But the rules have caused widespread discontent. In a closed-door meeting this week, many social media and tech company executives discussed strategies to urge New Delhi to put the rules on hold, according to a source with direct knowledge. The source said European authorities require data breaches to be reported within about 72 hours, adding that it was difficult to report incidents in six hours. Chandrasekhar, however, said India was being generous, as some countries mandate immediate reporting. The rules are set to be enforced from end of June. After they were announced, NordVPN, one of the world's largest VPN providers, said it may remove its servers from India. Privacy activists have said the rules contradict the idea of VPN, which is to safeguard identity of individuals such as whistleblowers from surveillance. ""If you don't want to go by these rules, and if you want to pull out, then frankly ... you have to pull out,"" Chandrasekhar told reporters.","India has tightened regulation of Big Tech firms in recent years, prompting pushback from industry .

35,"Formula One's 2022 season will be reduced to 22 races after the sport said on Wednesday it would not be replacing the cancelled Russian Grand Prix on Sept. 25 despite interest from other countries. Formula One had scheduled a record 23 rounds this year but the race in Sochi was called off in February and the contract terminated in early March after the country's invasion of Ukraine. The sport had said it would fill the slot, with various options including Qatar and Turkey as well as a second race in Singapore, but there will now be an extra break before the Singapore-Japan double header. Another race in Europe was considered too much of a logistical challenge while temperatures in Qatar -- which returns to the calendar next year as part of a 10-year agreement -- raised concerns. Formula One also had to balance the commercial value of holding a 23rd race over the additional costs placed on all concerned, with teams already wrestling with inflationary pressures and more expensive hotels and flights. The decision not to add a replacement was announced on the official website www.formula1.com. It means there will now be a two-weekend break between the Aug 28 to Sept. 11 European triple header of Belgium-Netherlands-Italy and Singapore-Japan on Oct 2 and 9. Formula One is set to expand again next season, with a Las Vegas night race set to debut as a third round in the United States.","Formula One's 2022 season will be reduced to 22 races after cancellation of Russian Grand Prix .

Birdwatchers in the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal and Bhutan came together for a unique inter-country exercise to document as many birds of the mountain range as possible. Photo: Special Arrangement
 Uttarakhand reported the highest number of bird species, at 293, while the maximum number of checklists (lists of birds seen and heard by birdwatchers), at 192, was uploaded from Jammu & Kashmir, according to the primary report from birdwatchers in the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal and Bhutan, who came together for a unique inter-country exercise to document as many birds of the mountain range as possible. The Himalayas, the tallest mountain range in the world, with its snow-capped mountains, cold deserts, lush green forests and grasslands, and white waters of rivers, are home to numerous unique birds. The exercise was undertaken on May 14 and a total of 607 species have been documented so far, in just one day. The 'Himalayan Bird Count' programme aimed to celebrate the incredible bird diversity of the Himalayas. ""Birdwatchers from Ladakh, including members of the Wildlife Conservation and Birds Club of Ladakh, spread out in various regions of Ladakh and uploaded 182 checklists.  In just 36 checklists, birdwatchers from Sikkim recorded 157 species. Similarly, 50 checklists yielded a whopping 234 species in Arunachal Pradesh,'' Gala Mittal from Bird Count India said. In India, the event was confined to Ladakh, J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, northwest Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh. In many places, birders took groups of people out for birdwatching, showing them the wonders of nature. Bird Count India is an informal partnership of organisations and groups interested in documenting and monitoring India's birds. The initiative encourages birdwatchers to upload their bird lists to eBird (ebird.org/india), a global platform for bird observations. This first edition of the event was co-organised by Bird Count India, Bird Conservation Nepal, and the Royal Society for Protection of Nature, Bhutan, which plan to bring the Himalayan birding fraternity together for a common good via more birding events such as this.  According to the organisers, around 1,000 lists were uploaded from India, Nepal and Bhutan on May 14. ""There was incredible participation from individual birdwatchers and various groups, ranging from government entities like the Himachal Pradesh Forest Department and bird clubs to various wildlife conservation organisations. Stretching from the westernmost Ladakh to the easternmost Arunachal Pradesh, the Himalayan region's biodiversity is threatened by rapid warming and rampant infrastructure development,'' Ms. Mittal said. ""Himalayan Bird Count can provide consistent, snapshot information of bird diversity in a region that is increasingly threatened by climate change. This kind of information, across years, can help us understand what's happening to our country's birds,"" said Ghazala Shahabuddin, senior fellow with the non-profit Centre for Ecology, Development and Research working in the Kumaon hills, Uttarakhand.

(Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today's Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) Both Meta Pixel and TikTok Pixel have a feature called Automatic Advanced Matching (AAM) that collects hashed personal identifiers from the web forms in an automated manner, according to researchers from KU Leuven, Radboud University, and University of Lausanne. Pixel is a code that lets platforms track visitor activity. This information can be used to target people with ads based on interests, preferences, and their behavior online. It can also measure the performance of ads. The hashed personal identifiers are then used to target ads on the respective platforms, measure conversions, or create new custom audiences. Meta's, and TikTok's documentation claim that AAM should trigger data collection when a user submits a form. However, researchers found that both the platforms collect hashed personal data when the user clicks links or buttons that in no way resemble a submit button.  Meta and TikTok scripts don't even try to recognise submit buttons.

38,"The 'grand' entry of the Adani Group into the cement sector through the likely acquisition of Ambuja Cement Ltd. and ACC Ltd. from Holcim Ltd. will spur consolidation in the sector as the group is known for assuming market leadership in any segment it operates in said analysts.  However, industry insiders preferred to wait and watch before offering any comment.    ""Over the longer term, we expect it [the $10.5 billion acquisition by Adani Family offshore Special Purpose Vehicle Endeavour Trade & Investment] to positively impact the cement sector with expectations of industry consolidation along with better pricing discipline,""Ronald Siyoni, AVP - research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said,  ""The acquisition would place Adani Group at number two position in India's cement sector. The high valuation ascribed to Holcim's assets may lead to the acquirer opting for generating better returns vis-a-vis employing aggressive competitive behaviour,"" Mr Siyoni added. According to Kamlesh Bagmar, Deputy Head of Research, Prabhudas Lilladher both the companies [Ambuja & ACC] would become very aggressive on cost competitiveness and capacity expansion which had been missing in a big way over the years.  ""This could increase competition in the industry, he said adding there is not much of consolidation opportunities of this magnitude left in the industry. Under the deal with Holcim, Adani Group has agreed to pay 7.3% premium over the last trading price of Ambuja Cement and 8.8% premium over the last trading price of ACC which augurs well for the shareholders, analysts said. Motilal Oswal in a note said the combined entity is expected to increase capacity to 80 million tonnes per annum by CY24E [from 70 million tonnes now. ""We would wait for announcement related to the funding of this deal. In our view, the acquirer will not chase growth capex immediately if it is a leveraged buy-out. In the long run, however, sector dynamics would depend on the growth plans and aggressiveness of the acquirer,"" the Motilal Oswal analysts wrote in the note. The Adani Group had been planning to enter the cement business for some time and it had formed a separate subsidiary called Adani Cement Industries Ltd. in June 21.  The company was reportedly planning to set up an integrated plant in Kutch, Gujarat and grinding units in Dahej, Gujarat and Raigad, Maharashtra.  It also had won limestone blocks in Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat through bidding process. This was prior to Sunday's significant announcement. And now, the sudden entry into the big league had changed the industry dynamics. Industry insiders, though taken aback by the aggressive bid by Adani, preferred to restrain themselves from commenting.  UltraTech Cement & JSW Cement declined to comment on the likely impact of Adani's entry into the sector. A call made to India Cements vice chairman & MD, N Srinivasan remained unanswered.  However, Shree Cements Ltd. chairman BG Bangur said, ""We have to see their [Adanis] style of functioning for six months before commenting. They are new to the sector. But the management style of both companies will remain the same for some time."" ""Today, consolidation does not take place at the wish of the buyer, it happens if the seller wants. Yes, consolidation may happen if they [Adanis] pay a handsome amount to the sellers,"" he added. He said so far, most part of the dividend paid out by Ambuja and ACC used to go to Holcim and now that would remain in India. He declined to quantify the impact on the sector by saying, ""If Mr. Kumar Mangalam Birla could have acquired both the companies, we could have some predictability but we are yet to know Mr. Adani who is very new to the sector,"" Mr. Bangur added. Manoj Dalmia, founder & director, Proficient Equities Private Ltd. said, ""Adani's entry might affect the pricing in the cement sector due to its power as a supplier."" Ravi Singhal, vice-chairman, GCL Securities Ltd. ""As we can see, ACC and Ambuja are steadily losing market share. However, the Adani Group is very aggressive and is making significant contributions to Indian infrastructure, which will benefit both Adani and ACC- Ambuja on demand prospects."" According to Ravi Singh, vice-president and head of Research, Share India, the transaction would help both the companies to slash costs, trim debt and better cope with the soaring energy prices and weaker demand that have hurt the sector so far.  ""Also, post the potential merger, there could be a consideration for brand consolidation leading to better margins and higher return on capital employed for the two companies,"" Mr Singh said. On Monday, the Adanis made open offer for acquiring additional shares of ACC and Ambuja Cement as per SEBI norms. While ACC shares gained 3.84% on the BSE, Ambuja Cement shares closed with a gain of 2.59%.",The 'grand' entry of the Adani Group into the cement sector through the likely acquisition of Ambuja Cement Ltd. and ACC Ltd. from Holcim Ltd. will spur consolidation in the sector as the group is known for assuming market leadership in any segment it operates in .

39,"Despite the World Gold Council's projection of a dip in consumer demand for the precious metal this fiscal on the back of rising prices and record imports last fiscal, a foreign brokerage has suggested in a report that demand may rise more than generally projected as households may snap up the metal as a hedge against spiralling inflation. Gold imports rose 33.3% to $46.14 billion in FY22 to 837 tonnes or 1.5 times above the pandemic low in FY21 and 12% more than the pre-pandemic average of FY16-20, leading to a higher current account deficit that's seen at 3% of GDP, government data showed last month. Imports were only worth $34.62 billion in the pandemic-hit FY21. After a record $54 billion worth of imports in FY13, inward gold shipments had been waning over the years, but then began to rise again and scaled $25 billion in FY21 and further to a tad more than $46 billion FY22. Gold imports are projected to marginally decline to $43 billion in FY23, according to UBS Securities India's report released on Monday.  The surge in gold imports in FY22 contributed to the widening of the trade deficit to $192.41 billion as against $102.62 billion in FY21. India is the world's second-biggest gold consumer after China. The imports are largely driven by the jewellery industry. Gem and jewellery exports grew about 50% to about $39 billion in FY22. The current account deficit widened to $23 billion or 2.7% of GDP in the first three quarters, according to RBI data.  ""Our regression analysis suggests that a 1 percentage point increase in inflation leads to 2.6% rise in gold demand. While the economic ramifications of persistently high inflation, stretched equity market valuations, recent losses in equity markets for retail investors and still low deposit rates can make a case for gold as an alternative asset class for the households in the near term,"" UBS Securities India said in a note on Monday.  Gold has gained importance as an investment asset over the years, and is viewed as a good hedge in the event of the rupee fall and against inflation in the short-term. Notably, gold's long-term returns over the past 15 years have outperformed equities and debt, despite these asset classes moving broadly in the same direction, according to the report.  The report quickly added that higher prices, however, may act as a deterrent and restrain investment demand. UBS chief India economist Tanvee Gupta Jain expects gold demand to slow to 750 tonnes in FY23 from 837 tonnes in FY22. Beyond safe-haven interest, there have been indications that a broader strategic interest in gold is emerging. As the bulk of the country's gold supply is imported, higher global prices, despite modestly softer demand in volume terms, imply net imports may remain elevated at $34 billion or 1% of GDP in FY23. She attributed the marginal fall to elevated global prices of the metal and softer domestic growth as real incomes were affected by rising energy prices, spiralling inflation and an incomplete recovery in the labour market. UBS recently raised its gold price forecast, but maintained a downward price profile into early 2023 largely reflecting safe haven flows following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February. Economic re-opening after the pandemic, higher household savings and pent-up demand boosted gold demand in FY22, with the December quarter recording a whopping 357 tonnes imports. But imports/demand fell to 141 tonnes in Q4, down 60% from Q3, driven by higher prices triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Households are becoming wealthier due to record high gold prices and their imputed wealth (based on their gold holdings) has risen sharply in recent years. Indians hold the largest stock of gold in the world at about 27,000 tonnes, which is 13% of the global stock and worth about $1.675 trillion or 53% of FY22 nominal GDP, according to WGC data. As against this, retail bank deposits were only about 46% of GDP as of December 2021 and the Reserve Bank holds gold worth $48 billion in its gold reserves.",Gold imports rose 33.3% to $46.14 billion in FY22 to 837 tonnes or 1.5 times above the pandemic low in FY21 and 12% more than the pre-pandemic average of FY16-20 .

41,"GUWAHATI The migration of border villagers has added to the challenges the Indian Army has been facing along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in trying to match the rapid enhancement of infrastructure and operational capabilities by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China. Lieutenant General Rana Pratap Kalita, chief of the Army's Eastern Command, said this in Guwahati on Monday, while asserting that the partial withdrawal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act from three northeastern States has aided the redeployment of troops on the northern borders of the eastern sector and focus more on China. ""Migration of people from near the LAC in Arunachal Pradesh has led to shortage of people to work in those areas. The outmigration to the hinterland has been compounded by the unwillingness of people from outside to work in those difficult areas,"" he said. Hundreds of villagers have moved to towns in the more accessible areas in search of greener pastures over the years. For the Army, this has added to the challenges of a tough terrain along the unstable eastern Himalayas and inclement weather in developing infrastructure and operational capabilities along the LAC.  On the situation along the Tibetan border, Lt Gen Kalita said the complexities arise because of the differences in perception about the line that has not been demarcated. ""But we have mechanisms in place in accordance with existing bilateral agreements and protocols to defuse tension and work towards peace and tranquillity along the LAC,"" he said. China has developed a lot of infrastructure in Tibet, which includes railway lines connecting border areas with the Chinese hinterland through Lhasa. They have also constructed many highways, certain roads in forward areas that connect the passes along the LAC, and upgraded airports and helipads, while additional areas have been taken to ensure the stationing of more aircraft and helicopters, the Eastern Command chief said. ""They have also developed their communication infrastructure. There is the availability of 5G mobile connectivity. All these infrastructure developments give them the capability to mobilise troops from the camps in a shorter time,"" he said, adding that the rolling plateaus of Tibet give China the operational advantage, unlike the landslide-prone mountains on the Indian side. ""One reason of concern for us is some villages located close to the LAC have the possibility of dual use. They can be used for civilians as well as to mobilise troops to the forward areas,"" Lt Gen Kalita said.  ""We all are conscious of these factors, are constantly monitoring the developments across the border and taking requisite steps to develop infrastructure on our side,"" he said. On the botched ambush at Oting in Nagaland's Mon district that left 13 civilians and a soldier dead on December 4, 2021, Lt Gen Kalita said action would be taken according to the Army Act against any soldiers found to have committed lapses.  ""The report of the Army's court of inquiry has been submitted. We also received the report of the Special Investigation Team constituted by the Nagaland Government. Both the reports are being analysed to identify the lapses that have taken place during the conduct of the operation,"" he said.  ""Let me assure you that any fault which we identify, requisite action will be taken against those individuals irrespective of their ranks or who they are,"" he said.  Lt Gen Kalita, who hails from Assam, said the Army was conscious of the fact that there had been an increase in recruitment by the Paresh Baruah faction of the extremist United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent or ULFA-I.  ""Most of these recruitments have taken place through the social media where they were motivated. I was given to understand most of them have a criminal background,"" he said.

42,"President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, May 16, 2022, named Labour Minister Elisabeth Borne as Prime Minister to lead his ambitious reform plans, the first woman to head the French government in over 30 years. Outgoing French Prime Minister Jean Castex earlier handed his resignation to the President, part of a widely expected reshuffle to make way for a new government in the wake of Mr. Macron's re-election in April. The last woman premier, Edith Cresson, briefly headed the Cabinet from May 1991 to April 1992 under president Francois Mitterrand. Ending weeks of speculation, the Elysee confirmed Ms. Borne's nomination in a statement and she then headed to the Matignon residence of the premier in Paris for the handover with Castex. The departure of Mr. Castex, who was a surprise choice for the role in 2020, enables Mr. Macron to reshape the Cabinet ahead of crucial parliamentary polls in June. The new government under Ms. Borne is expected to be announced in the next days. The centrist Macron will need a legislative majority to push through his domestic agenda following his re-election, with a new left-wing alliance and the far-right threatening to block his programme. Speculation has been rife in recent weeks about Mr. Castex's replacement, with Mr. Macron indicating he wanted a woman with left-wing and environmental credentials. Those criteria reflect his desire to focus on schools and health in the early part of his second term, as well as the climate crisis which he has promised to prioritise. Ms. Borne, 61, is seen as an able technocrat who can negotiate prudently with unions, as the President embarks on a new package of social reforms that notably include a rise in the retirement age which risks sparking protests. A French presidential official, who asked not to be named, described Ms. Borne as a woman of ""conviction, action and realisation,"" noting her ""capacity to carry out reforms."" ""It was high time there was another woman,"" Ms. Cresson, who knows Ms. Borne personally, told BFM-TV. ""She is a remarkable person, with great experience in the public and private sectors... She's a very good choice because she's a remarkable person, not because she's a woman,"" she added. She expressed amazement that it had taken France — which has never had a female head of state — so long to have another woman Prime Minister. ""France is very behind — not the French population but the political class,"" added Ms. Cresson, who was the target of numerous sexist attacks during her time in office.","President Emmanuel Macron named Elisabeth Borne as Prime Minister .

In a report released last week, the WHO had estimated 4.7 million deaths directly or indirectly linked to Covid-19 in India in the years 2020 and 2021, about ten times what the government figures estimate, which would make the death toll in India the highest in the world.  Government sources had called the study flawed, and contested the data, collection methodology and model used by the WHO, adding that India's concerns had been raised with WHO Director General Tedros Ghebreyesus during his visit to India to launch a WHO centre for traditional medicine along with PM Modi. India also protested the long delay in obtaining WHO approval for the Indian-made Covaxin developed by Bharat Biotech, which was finally given in November 2021. In his speech at the session, Mr. Ghebreyesus referred to the massive global Covid deaths estimate of just under 15 million people worldwide, and called for a renewed push for vaccine supply and distribution to reach a goal of 70% of the population, funding the WHO's Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, and more contributions to close the funding gap for countering Covid, which he said was short by about $15 billion. U.S. President Biden addressed the conference just as the US reached what he called a ""tragic milestone"" of one million Covid deaths and ""one million empty chairs around the family dinner table."". While he didn't refer to the India-South Africa proposal for the full waiver of patents on Covid medicines and vaccines, which is still being discussed in Geneva, he announced that the US will share ""critical COVID-19 technologies"" through the WHO, including stabilized spike protein that is used in many COVID-19 vaccines. In his speech, Mr. Modi said India's vaccination programme is the largest in the world and that India has fully vaccinated almost 90 percent of the adult population. China has a higher population than India, and claims it has administered about 331 crore vaccines (3.3 billion) compared to about 191 crore vaccines administered in India. ""India supplied over 200 million doses to 98 countries, bilaterally and through COVAX (global distribution network). India has developed low-cost COVID mitigation technologies for testing, treating and data management. We have offered these capabilities to other countries,"" the Prime Minister added. The conference was co-hosted by United States, Belize, Germany, Indonesia, and Senegal, and included the participation of more than 30 countries. According to a US government release, the 2nd global covid summit brought in more than $3 billion in new financial commitments from the participants, multilateral and philanthropic organisation that has not been announced,in addition to commitments made in 2021 and 2022. ","Prime Minister Narendra Modi calls for reform of the UN health body and review of its processes on vaccine approvals .

46," Scientists from the Event Horizon Telescope(EHT) facility, a collaboration of over 300 researchers, revealed the first image of the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way in press conferences held around the world. This image of the black hole referred to as Sagittarius A* (SgrA*) gave further support to the idea that the compact object at the centre of our galaxy is indeed a black hole. This strengthens Einstein's general theory of relativity. In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope made history by releasing the first ever image of a black hole M87* – the black hole at the centre of a galaxy Messier 87, which is a supergiant elliptic galaxy. The ring-shaped image of SgrA*, which looked a lot similar to the one of M87*, occupied 52 micro arcseconds in the field of view, which is as big a span of our view as a doughnut on the moon! The whole exercise was possible because of the enormous power of the Event Horizon Telescope, an ensemble of several telescopes around the world, which together were like a giant eye on the earth with a sight that is 3 million times sharper than the human eye. Sagittarius A* is 27,000 light years from us. At the press conference held simultaneously at several centres around the world, the researchers said that imaging Sagittarius A* (SgrA*), the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, was much more difficult than imaging M87* for the following reasons: firstly, SgrA* is only one-thousandth the size of M87*; secondly, the line of sight is obscured by a lot of matter; and as SgrA* is much smaller than M87*, the gas swirling around it takes mere minutes to complete an orbit around SgrA* as opposed to taking weeks to go around M87*. The last gives a variability that makes it difficult to image. A clear imaging requires long exposure of about 8-10 hours, where ideally the object should not change much. In this relation, Venkatessh Ramakrishnan, who is a postdoctoral researcher at Aalto University Metsahovi Radio Observatory, a key member of the calibration and imaging team, says ""Since the physics of plasma flows around SgrA* changes on an hourly time-scale, getting a coherent image with all relevant information from photons corresponding to one orbit is difficult. This requires higher sensitive observations which comes with the addition of more telescopes to the EHT and with advanced image reconstruction algorithms."" He is an author of the paper on this work that is published today in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. The collaboration hopes to improve their capacity so that they can not only image black holes but construct movies and study the magnetic field further.

48,"The capex-driven fiscal path laid out by the government in the Union Budget will help the economy weather inflationary headwinds and post almost 8% real growth in 2022-23, the Finance Ministry said in its monthly economic review on Thursday.  The ministry's GDP growth projection is faster than the 7.2% pace forecast by the RBI last month.  Citing the International Monetary Fund's 8.2% forecast, the ministry said that India would be the fastest growing economy in 2022-23 and added the 'strong growth in economic activity' in April lent 'credence' to this projection. This was reflected in the 'robust performance of e-way bill generation, ETC toll collection, electricity consumption, PMI manufacturing and PMI services' as well as record GST collection for March transactions, it asserted. While the yields on government securities rose to 7.11% in April, the spread between the U.S. 10-year treasury yield and the Indian 10-year G-sec yield had narrowed to 421 basis points (bps) in April, from 494 bps in February, indicating a strengthening in India's macroeconomic fundamentals, the Finance Ministry said. One basis point equals 0.01 percentage point.  The ministry blamed the 'steadily declining' forex reserves due to 'pressure from outflow of foreign portfolio investments (FPI) responding to monetary tightening by central banks in advanced economies'. However, the quantum of outflow in April was much lower than the previous three months, it pointed out.  India's forex reserves, which stood at $597.7 billion on April 29, could provide import cover of about 11 months for financing investment and consumption in the country. ""Given the rising levels of profitability and strengthening balance sheets of the corporate sector, FPI inflows are expected to return to positive territory,"" the ministry said.  Noting that imported inflation, especially higher global prices for crude and edible oil would now significantly impact India's inflation outlook, the ministry said that government measures to keep the prices of these commodities in check along with the recent increase in policy rates by the RBI were expected to temper inflationary pressures in the economy.  ""Rising food and energy prices are a global phenomenon and even several advanced nations have higher inflation rates than India,"" it emphasised. The RBI, it said, had signalled its determination to combat inflation with the recent 40 basis points increase in the repo rate and an increase in the Cash Reserve Ratio requirement for banks, which would also sustain macroeconomic stability and growth.  However, the inflation trajectory in the coming months would be influenced more by the geopolitical situation, international commodity prices and supply chain management, the ministry noted.  ""Global growth watchers, as their slowing growth projections reflect, have also factored in monetary tightening the world over to calm down global inflation,"" it said, adding that the cost of restraining inflation would be slowing global growth. ""If global inflation does not sufficiently decline despite aggressive monetary tightening sharply slowing growth, it points at the persistence of supply-demand imbalances that only coordinated actions of world leaders can resolve,"" the ministry concluded.",Finance Ministry says capex-driven fiscal path will help economy weather inflationary headwinds .

49,"Thousands of Palestinians on May 12 honoured Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh across the occupied West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem, a day after she was shot dead during an Israeli army raid. Israel and the Palestinians have traded blame over the killing of Palestinian-American Abu Akleh, 51, a veteran of the Qatar-based network's Arabic service, during clashes in the Jenin refugee camp. The United States, European Union and United Nations have backed calls for a full investigation into what Al Jazeera labelled a deliberate killing ""in cold blood"", but the Palestinian Authority (PA) has rejected holding a joint probe with Israel. In a sign of Abu Akleh's stature among Palestinians, she received what was described as a full state memorial at the Ramallah compound of president Mahmud Abbas. Thousands lined the route as her coffin, draped in the Palestinian flag, was driven through the West Bank city, where a street is to be renamed in her honour. Many held flowers, wreaths and pictures of the slain journalist, who has been widely hailed for her bravery and professionalism through her coverage of the conflict. 'Wound in our hearts' ""This crime should not go unpunished,"" said Mr. Abbas, adding that the PA held Israel ""completely responsible"" for her death, and had ""rejected"" an Israeli proposal for a joint investigation. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett had said May 11 it was ""likely"" Abu Akleh was killed by stray Palestinian gunfire - but Defence Minister Benny Gantz later conceded that it could have been ""the Palestinians who shot her"" or fire from ""our side"". On a visit to Tehran, Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani blamed ""Israeli occupation forces"" for the ""heinous crime"". Mr. Bennett on May 12 accused the PA of blocking Israel from accessing ""the basic findings that would be necessary in order to reach the truth,"" and warned them not to ""taint the investigative process."" Draped in a Palestinian scarf, mourner Tariq Ahmed, 45, described the death as a ""tragedy for all the nation"", comparing his grief to that he felt at the funeral of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. ""I have not felt this pain since Arafat died,"" Mr. Ahmed said. Another mourner, 45-year-old Hadil Hamdan, said that ""Shireen was part of our lives"", adding that ""her voice entered every home, and her loss is a wound in our hearts"". No joint probe Abu Akleh, a Christian born in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, is scheduled to be buried in the city on May 13. As her coffin began its journey to Jerusalem to the drumbeat of a marching band, crowds chanted slogans demanding an end to Palestinian security cooperation with Israel. Israel had publicly called for a joint probe and stressed the need for Palestinian authorities to hand over the fatal bullet for forensic examination. The European Union has urged an ""independent"" probe while the United States demanded the killing be ""transparently investigated"", calls echoed by U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet. But senior PA official Hussein Al-Sheikh, a close Abbas confidant, said the Palestinian ""investigation would be completed independently"". He added that Abu Akleh's family, the United States, Qatar and ""all official authorities"" would be informed of the results. An initial autopsy and forensic examination were conducted in Nablus in the Israel-occupied West Bank hours after her death, but no final conclusions have been disclosed. A source in the Palestinian attorney general's office said the results of a preliminary report on the bullet were expected as early as May 12 evening. - New Jewish settlements - In a move likely to further inflame West Bank tensions, Israel today advanced plans for 4,427 Jewish settler homes. About 475,000 settlers already live in the West Bank, alongside some 2.7 million Palestinians, in communities widely regarded as illegal under international law. Settlement monitor Peace Now warned the announcement ""deepens the occupation,"" while right-wing Interior Minister Ayelet Shaked, a member of Bennett's religious nationalist Yamina party, hailed a ""day of celebration for the settler movement."" Tensions had already risen with a wave of attacks that have killed at least 18 people in Israel since March 22, including an Arab-Israeli police officer and two Ukrainians. A total of 31 Palestinians and three Israeli Arabs have died during the same period, according to an AFP tally, among them perpetrators of attacks and those killed by Israeli security forces in West Bank operations.","Thousands line route as Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh's coffin is driven through the West Bank .

50,"Chennai Super Kings are out of reckoning for the IPL play-offs after losing to Mumbai Indians on Thursday, but captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni hinted that his side will come back stronger next season with more fast bowlers in their arsenal.  MI beat CSK by five wickets in a low-scoring match to send the Dhoni-led side out of reckoning for a play-off berth.  MI chased down a target of 98 with 31 balls to spare.  ""The fast bowlers, to have both of them (Mukesh Choudhary and Simarjeet Singh) bowling really well is a big positive. Not to forget we'll have two more fast bowlers coming in to the next season and we have a few more up our sleeves. We just want to give them ample time to prepare for what the IPL holds for them,"" Dhoni said at the post-match presentation.  ""So we have a few positives that we'll take into the next season but what is important is that whatever gaps are there, to try to fill in those gaps so that leakages don't happen.""  The former India captain was happy that the IPL has seen the rise of many fast bowlers.  ""It's good to have them. We have gone through a period where we never had extraordinary bench strength with fast bowlers. Also what happens is fast bowlers, they take their time to mature. If you're lucky, you get somebody who in six months' time can feature in all the different formats, whether Test cricket, one-day or T20. I feel that's what IPL is doing.  ""It's an opportunity for them and a lot of them become slightly more bold and a bit more courageous which is important in a format like this. They want to take the opposition head on and that has been the difference.  ""You see a few who are not those types, who shy away initially but as they play more games, they get more and more confident and are able to execute their plans better.""  He said irrespective of the nature of the wicket, anything below 130 was difficult to defend.  ""I asked the bowlers to show a lot of character, put the opposition under pressure and forget about the result. I feel both the young fast bowlers bowled really well. As far as their contribution is concerned, I feel a game like this really helps them.  ""It's something that they start believing in themselves. Whenever we start, we need the same kind of attitude and that's what is needed in the shortest format.""  During the CSK innings, Dhoni ran out of partners, leaving him stranded at 36.  Asked what he said to his batters, Dhoni stated, ""What was important is that when you're batting under that kind of pressure, it's the first few deliveries that are important. I said to be themselves. If they want to hit the first delivery, then go for it. It's a chance for survival.  ""If they pass those first few deliveries, then they can be themselves. It didn't pay off but at the same time the opposition bowled really well and a bit of application was needed from our side. A few of our batters got out on good deliveries.  ""We can't really help that but other than that these are the kind of games where you learn a lot so hopefully they are learning from each and every game.""  MI captain Rohit Sharma said looking at how the pitch was playing and his team losing wickets upfront, there were tense moments in the middle.  ""It was just about keeping calm and getting the job done. We were a little calm and got the job done in the end,"" he said.  ""We have played a lot of cricket here. We've had pitches like this. It's nice to get bowlers into the game as well at times. It's been batting-friendly all over, it was good to see bounce and swing from both sides which was good to watch.""  MI have already been out of reckoning for a play-off berth. On the future of the team, he said, ""We are keeping one eye (on the future), we want to win games and at the same time we try out certain players. There are options that we still want to try.""  He said batter Tilak Varma, who took MI home with an unbeaten 34, can play for India soon.  ""He (Tilak) has been brilliant, playing for the first year, having such a calm head is never easy. I feel he's going to be an all-format player for India pretty soon. He's got the technique and temperament. And there's hunger as well.""  On pacer Jasprit Bumrah, Rohit said, ""He knows what he needs to do and what the team expects him to do. He understands, magnificent spell upfront.""  Asked about veteran Kieron Pollard, who did not play on Thursday, the skipper said, ""He's been a stalwart, he came out and said that he's okay with that.""

(Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today's Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) The suspension comes just three weeks after the U.S. automaker partially resumed production at the Shanghai plant on April 19 following a 22-day closure caused by the city's COVID-19 lockdown, reflecting the complexity and uncertainties of keeping manufacturing going as China battles the coronavirus. It is unclear when the supply issues can be resolved and when Tesla can resume production, said the people, who declined to be identified as the matter is private. Shanghai is now in its sixth week of lockdown. Among Tesla suppliers facing issues is wire harness maker Aptiv which had to stop shipping supplies from a plant that supplies Tesla and General Motors after infections were found among its employees, sources said on Monday. Tesla did not immediately respond to a query for comment. The company was aiming to increase output at its Shanghai plant to 2,600 cars a day from May 16, as it seeks to restore production to levels before the lockdown. The disruption to Tesla's Shanghai plant has been one of the highest-profile consequences of China's measures to control its biggest COVID-19 outbreak, which have also crimped consumption, including vehicle sales. China's auto association said last week it estimated auto sales in China dropped 48% in April as zero-COVID lockdowns shut factories, limited traffic to showrooms and put the brakes on spending. Shanghai authorities have tightened a city-wide lockdown imposed more than a month ago on the commercial hub with a population of 25 million, a move that could extend curbs on movement through the month.

53,"I The Government's affidavit asking the Supreme Court to keep the sedition case pending during the reconsideration of the colonial law does not agree with a Constitution Bench judgment, which held that the Government cannot speak for or make promises to the court on behalf of Parliament. While the Bench led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana said it ""respects the government's word"", Justice Surya Kant, speaking from the Bench, made it a point to observe that ""the government cannot give guarantees on behalf of the Parliament"". A ""reconsideration"" of Section 124A would entail legislative process. The Supreme Court cannot give the Parliament a deadline to complete the process. Neither can the government promise the Supreme Court a specific outcome from the Parliament. The Parliament stands alone and independent in its domain of law-making. Then how can the government, through an affidavit, ask the Supreme Court to halt its constitutional duty to examine the constitutionality of Section 124A and await the results of the reconsideration of the colonial provision?  ""The deponents of the affidavits filed in court may speak for the parties on whose behalf they swear to the statement. They do not speak for the Parliament. No one may speak for the Parliament and Parliament is never before the court,"" the Constitution Bench in Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing Company versus Bharat Coking Coal Limited had held in 1982. The judgment held that the court was the only ""authentic voice"" which may echo or interpret the Parliament's voice once a statute leaves the Parliament House. ""After Parliament has said what it intends to say, only the court may say what the Parliament meant to say. None else,"" the five-judge Bench had held. When the government files an affidavit containing its understanding of a Parliamentary law or the facts and circumstances which led to the particular law, it speaks for itself and not for the Parliament, the Constitution Bench had noted.  The court should not even concern itself with the statements made in an affidavit, the judgment said. The court has to reach its own conclusions about the legality of a law. ""Validity of a legislation is not to be judged merely by affidavits filed on behalf of the State, but by all the relevant circumstances which the court may ultimately find and more especially by what may be gathered from what the legislature has itself said,"" the Constitution Bench had stressed. Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, who drew the attention of the apex court to the Sanjeev Coke judgment, said there was a ""pattern"" to the filing of such affidavits by the government side. ""When the Puttuswamy case (privacy) was about to be closed, the government filed a memo in the Supreme Court saying Justice B.N. Srikrishna Committee has been formed to look into the issues. In the marital rape case before the Delhi High Court, the government said it is reconsidering the law..."" Mr. Sankaranarayanan submitted amidst objections from Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal said the court could not wait merely because there was an ""intention"" to reconsider the sedition provision, the doing of which may take six months to a year. ""Each institution has its job. The legislature makes laws. It is for you [Supreme Court] to decide whether a law is constitutional or not,"" Mr. Sibal argued.

We have to see, how do we accelerate that advantage and at the same time reduce the risk... to mitigate risks? Whatever legal structure we make, it needs to have cyber security as a key element. Other key elements are accountability of social media and protection of personal data,"" the source said. The work is going on on this and the government will soon initiate discussions with industry and stakeholders on the new framework.

For LIC, the first-year premium rose 141.3% at ₹11,716.70 crore (₹4,856.76 crore), a development that is bound to bring cheer for the behemoth ahead of the listing of its shares. Private life insurers logged a 27.5% growth in total first-year premium (FYP) to ₹6,222.92 crore, the new business statement for the 24 insurers issued by IRDAI showed. Of the 22 operational private firms, six reported a decline in the FYP. Emkay Global said in a research report that a three-year compound annual growth rate would present a true picture of expansion, considering a stringent nationwide lockdown in April 2020 and the impact of the COVID-19 Delta wave in April last year. On a three-year CAGR basis, private life insurers delivered RWRP (retail weighted received premium) growth of 18% as against 5% for LIC. The year-on-year growth will start to normalise from the second quarter of this financial year, once the favourable base effect goes away. Additionally, April is a relatively leaner month for life insurers, so extrapolating the numbers for the month to the full year would not be correct, it pointed out in the report.","Life insurance companies reported a robust 84.2% increase in first-year premium to ?17,939.62 crore for April .

56,"Zaporizhzhia [Ukraine] Russian troops pounded the vital port of Odesa, Ukrainian officials said on May 10, an apparent effort to disrupt the supply lines and Western weapons shipments critical to Kyiv's defence. Ukraine's ability to stymie a larger, better-armed Russian military has surprised many who had anticipated a much quicker conflict. With the war now in its 11th week and Kyiv bogging Russian forces down and even staging a counteroffensive, Ukraine's Foreign Minister appeared to suggest the country could expand its aims beyond merely pushing Russia back to areas it or its allies held on the day of the February 24 invasion. One of the most dramatic examples of Ukraine's ability to deny Moscow easy victories has been Mariupol, where Ukrainian fighters remained holed up at a steel plant, denying Russia's full control of the city. The regiment defending the plant said on May 10 that Russian warplanes continued pounding it. In recent days, the United Nations and Red Cross organised a dramatic rescue of what some officials said were the last civilians trapped at the plant. But on May 10, two officials said about 100 were believed to still be in the complex's underground tunnels. Others said that was impossible to confirm. In another harrowing example of the grisly toll the war continues to take, the Ukrainians said they found the bodies of 44 civilians in the rubble of a building destroyed weeks ago in the northeastern city of Izyum. The Ukrainian military said Russian forces fired seven missiles on May 9 at Ukraine's largest port, Odesa, hitting a shopping center and a warehouse. One person was killed and five wounded, the military said. Images overnight showed a burning building and debris — including a tennis shoe — in a heap of destruction in the city on the Black Sea. Mayor Gennady Trukhanov later visited the warehouse and said it ""had nothing in common with military infrastructure or military objects."" Ukraine alleged at least some of the munitions used dated to the Soviet era, making them unreliable in targeting. But the Center for Defense Strategies, a Ukrainian think tank tracking the war, said Moscow used some precision weapons against Odesa: Kinzhal, or ""Dagger,"" hypersonic air-to-surface missiles. Ukrainian, British and U.S. officials say Russia is rapidly using up its stock of precision weapons, raising the risk of more imprecise rockets being used as the conflict grinds on. Ever since President Vladimir Putin's forces failed to take Kyiv early in the war, his focus shifted to the eastern industrial heartland of the Donbas — but one general has suggested Moscow's aims also include cutting Ukraine's maritime access to both the Black and Azov seas. That would also give it a swath of territory that would link Russia to both the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized in 2014, and Transnistria, a pro-Moscow region of Moldova. Even if it falls short of severing Ukraine from the coast — and it appears to lack the forces to do so — continuing missile strikes on Odesa reflect the city's strategic importance. The Russian military has repeatedly targeted its airport and claimed it destroyed several batches of Western weapons. Odesa is also a major gateway for grain shipments, and its blockade by Russia already threatens global food supplies. Beyond that, the city is a cultural jewel, dear to Ukrainians and Russians alike, and targeting it carries symbolic significance as well. In Mariupol, Russians also bombarded the Azovstal steel mill, the Azov regiment said, targeting the sprawling complex 34 times in the past 24 hours. Attempts to storm the plant also continued, it said. Meanwhile, Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the city's mayor, estimated on social media that at least 100 civilians are trapped in the plant. Donetsk regional Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said those who remain are people ""that the Russians have not selected"" for evacuation. The two officials didn't say how they knew civilians were still in the complex — a warren of tunnels and bunkers spread over 11 square kilometers (4 square miles). Sviatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment, told The Associated Press that he could not confirm any civilians remained. Mayor Vadym Boichenko also said there was no way to know. With Russian forces struggling to gain ground in the Donbas, military analysts suggest that hitting Odesa might serve to stoke concern about southwestern Ukraine, thus forcing Kyiv to put more forces there. That would pull them away from the eastern front as Ukraine's military stages counteroffensives near the northeastern city of Kharkiv, aiming to push the Russians back across the border there. Kharkiv and the surrounding area has been under sustained Russian attack since the early in the war. In recent weeks, grisly pictures testified to the horrors of those battles, with charred and mangled bodies strewn in one street. Dozens of bodies were found in a five-story building that collapsed in March in Izyum, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) from Kharkiv, said Oleh Synehubov, the head of the regional administration. Ukraine's foreign minister, meanwhile, appeared to voice increasing confidence — and expanded goals — amid Russia's stalled offensive. ""In the first months of the war, the victory for us looked like withdrawal of Russian forces to the positions they occupied before February 24 and payment for inflicted damage,"" Dmytro Kuleba said in an interview with the Financial Times. ""Now if we are strong enough on the military front and we win the battle for Donbas, which will be crucial for the following dynamics of the war, of course the victory for us in this war will be the liberation of the rest of our territories."" That appears to indicate that Ukraine wants to try to retake Crimea as well as regions of the Donbas taken by Russia and the separatists it backs. But the comments seemed to reflect political ambitions more than battlefield realities: Many analysts acknowledge that while Russia isn't capable of making quick gains, the Ukrainian military isn't strong enough to drive the Russians back. Also Tuesday, the Ukrainian military warned that Russia could target the country's chemical industries. It did not elaborate but Russian shelling has previously targeted oil depots and other industrial sites. U.S. President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan measure on May 9 to reboot the World War II-era ""lend-lease"" program, which helped defeat Nazi Germany, to bolster Kyiv and its allies. Western powers continued to rally around Ukraine's embattled government. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock traveled to the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where the bodies of civilians — some bound, burned or shot at close range — were found after Russian forces withdrew. ""We owe it to the victims that we don't just commemorate them here but that we hold the perpetrators to account,"" she said. ","Russian troops pounded the vital port of Odesa, Ukrainian officials said on May 10, an apparent effort to disrupt the supply lines and Western weapons shipments critical to Kyiv's defence .

Dr. Somanath stressed on the need to enhance the country's engagement in the space industry that was estimated to be worth $440 billion. With a share of hardly 2%, India had a long way to go to match other countries in terms of space applications.  ""The (Central) government has felt the need for infusing private capital in the sector through reforms. Private players must be enabled to undertake the tasks with the support of the space sector that is available in the country. The focus must be on bringing technology from outside and creating manufacturing hubs to boost space technology in India,"" he said.  Companies would soon be allowed to build and operate space crafts and rockets on their own. The domain would no longer remain the exclusive right of the ISRO, Dr. Somanath said.

61," This time, the Spanish player being celebrated on center court wasn't Rafael Nadal. The loud cheers from spectators at the Caja Mágica in Madrid were, instead, directed at the teenage sensation considered the Spanish successor to the all-time great Nadal. In a clash of generations, 19-year-old Carlos Alcaraz overcame an injury to defeat his idol 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 in the Madrid Open quarterfinals on Friday. The teen recovered from a bad ankle twist early in the second set to earn his first victory against Nadal, marking what could be the beginning of a change of guard in Spanish tennis. ""It's obvious there's (a change in guard),"" Nadal said. ""He turned 19 yesterday, I'm almost 36 years old. If (the change) begins today or not, we will find out in the next few months. I'm happy for him. He was better than me in several aspects of the game."" Nadal also was loudly supported throughout the match, and the five-time champion received a huge ovation as he left the court. Alcaraz was emotional afterwards. ""It means a lot to me to beat Rafa, to beat the best player in the history on clay,"" he said. ""This is the result of all the hard work I've done."" It was Nadal's first loss to a Spaniard in six years, since to Fernando Verdasco at the 2016 Australian Open. He had a 138-21 record against his countrymen before facing Alcaraz for a third time. The ninth-ranked Alcaraz is the youngest ever semi-finalist in Madrid. He will next face top-ranked Novak Djokovic, who eased past Hubert Hurkacz 6-3, 6-4. The other semifinal will be between Stefanos Tsitsipas and defending champion Alexander Zverev. The fourth-seeded Tsitsipas defeated Andrey Rublev 6-3, 2-6, 6-4, while the second-seeded Zverev beat Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-3, 7-5. Still far from his best form after a six-week injury layoff, Nadal predicted a hard time keeping up with the energy of Alcaraz. He was right early on, as the youngster overpowered him to easily win the first set with three breaks. But Alcaraz lost momentum after needing medical attention for his right ankle, losing 20 of the next 22 points as Nadal cruised through the second set. ""It was a little bit painful, but it was no reason to do the second set that I have done,"" Alcaraz said. ""I think that I have let myself go. I was thinking of my ankle all the time and not on playing the match."" The match also was interrupted in the second set after a fan became ill in the stands. Both players got off to a great start this season; both have a tour-leading three titles already. Nadal's run was hampered by a rib stress fracture he sustained in his semifinal win against Alcaraz in Indian Wells. Nadal saved four match points to get past David Goffin in a third-round match that lasted more than three hours on Thursday. He said it was a positive balance for him after winning two matches following his injury layoff. ""It's an easy loss to digest in that regard, because we knew what we could expect here,"" he said. ""My only dream is (to) be in Paris (for the French Open) healthy enough and physically good enough to compete at the highest level possible."" Three-time Madrid champion Djokovic had little trouble against Hurkacz. The Serb took advantage of Hurkacz's slow start and took a 3-0 lead after the Polish player ceded his first service game by hitting long. Another spate of unforced errors cost Hurkacz a second-set break when he smacked a forehand long. Djokovic's dominance was never ended, and he won on his fourth match point. Djokovic is trying to regain his best form after not being allowed to play in the Australian Open because he was not vaccinated. ""It's definitely a positive indication that I am on the right track in terms of getting to the desired level of tennis, being in one of the best tournaments in the world where all the best players are playing,"" he said. ""It does give me confidence, and it encourages me to keep going. I have a lot of positives to take from the last couple of days."" Djokovic beat Gael Monfils in straight sets to start his campaign at the outdoor clay tournament, and a walkover after Andy Murray withdrew because of a stomach illness before their match on Thursday. Djokovic praised Alcaraz after arriving in Madrid this week and said his son had already replaced Nadal with the young Spaniard as his favorite player.

66,"The third long-duration team of astronauts launched by SpaceX to the International Space Station (ISS) for NASA safely departed the orbiting outpost early on May 5 to begin their descent back to Earth, capping a six-month science mission. The SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule carrying three U.S. NASA astronauts and a German astronaut from the European Space Agency (ESA) undocked from the ISS shortly after 1 a.m. EDT (0500 GMT) to embark on a return flight expected to last about 23 hours. A live video showing the capsule moving away from the station was shown on a NASA webcast. Wearing helmeted white-and-black spacesuits, the four astronauts were seen strapped into the crew cabin shortly before the spacecraft separated from the space station, orbiting some 250 miles (400 km) above the Earth. A few brief rocket thrusts then autonomously pushed the capsule safely clear of the ISS. If all goes smoothly, the Crew Dragon craft, dubbed Endurance, will parachute into the sea off the coast of Florida at 12:43 a.m. EDT on Friday (0443 GMT). The Endurance crew, consisting of American astronauts Tom Marshburn, 61, Raja Chari, 44, and Kayla Barron, 34, along with ESA crewmate Matthias Maurer, 52, arrived at the space station on November 11. Their departure came about a week after they welcomed their replacement team aboard the station, also currently home to three Russian cosmonauts on a long-term mission. One of those cosmonauts, Oleg Artemyev, assumed command of the ISS from Marshburn in a handover before Thursday's undocking, NASA said. Earlier in April, a separate all-private astronaut crew launched by SpaceX to the space station under contract for the Houston-based company Axiom Space left the orbiting laboratory, concluding two weeks in orbit. The NASA-ESA team flying home on Thursday was officially designated ""Crew-3,"" the third full-fledged long-duration group of astronauts that SpaceX has launched to the space station for the U.S. space agency. They will be carrying some 550 pounds of cargo with them on their flight back to Earth. SpaceX, the California-based company founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric carmaker Tesla Inc who recently clinched a deal to buy social media platform Twitter has launched a total of seven human spaceflights over the past two years.","Crew Dragon capsule carrying three U.S. astronauts and a German astronaut departs International Space Station .

67,"Jet Airways could be inching closer to restarting flights with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) expected to schedule its proving flights next week following which the airline will be granted an aircraft operator's certificate (AOC). ""The proving flights are likely to start soon. The airline will have to conduct 10 such flights. We expect this to take 30 days after which the airline will get its aircraft operator's certificate subject to security clearance,"" a senior DGCA official said on the condition of anonymity. After the aircraft operator's certificate is granted, the National Company Law Tribunal will proceed to transfer the ownership of assets such as Jet Airway's 11 aircraft to the Jalan-Kalrock consortium which was the successful resolution applicant of the insolvency process. This will pave the way for the airline to place an order for planes, and start talks with airports for slots. The airline aims to resume operations by the third quarter of calendar year 2022. May 5th was also an important milestone for the airline which operated a Boeing 737 aircraft using its IATA code 9W after a gap of three years since ceasing operations due to a cash crunch. Thursday's flight was a test flight over Hyderabad conducted after the aircraft underwent maintenance work, including engine replacement. After that the plane flew to Delhi for the proving flights for the regulator likely next week.  ""We are in the final stages for the AOC, and hope to be able to schedule the proving flights soon,"" the spokesperson for Jalan-Kalrock consortium said in a statement.",Jet Airways could be inching closer to restarting flights with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) expected to schedule its proving flights next week following which the airline will be granted an aircraft operator's certificate (AOC) The airline aims to resume operations by the third quarter of calendar year 2022 .,"Jet Airways could be inching closer to restarting flights with DGCA expected to schedule its proving flights next week following which the airline will be granted an aircraft operator's certificate.

68,"The United Nations' World Food Programme (WFP) has said that it is in discussions with India on procurement of wheat as several countries face food security challenges amid the Ukraine war. ""We are in discussions with India on procurement of wheat. So, that is something which is ongoing,"" the WFP's Chief Economist Arif Husain said at a news conference here on Wednesday. He was responding to a question on India having a huge surplus of wheat and whether the organisation was doing anything to utilise this stockpile with India as the Russia-Ukraine war has exacerbated the global food security situation. To a different question on whether restrictions by the World Trade Organisation over how much India can export should be suspended amid the current emergency, Mr. Husain said one of their recommendations is about exemption of the WFP from export bans. He noted that a couple of weeks ago, several agencies of the UN had encouraged governments not to impose export bans, which then artificially increased the price or reduced the availability of major staple commodities. ""So this is something which is a very big recommendation and hopefully, countries are listening,"" he said. India's wheat production stood at 109.59 million tonnes in the 2020-21 crop year (July-June). Earlier this year, India began sending shipments of wheat to Afghanistan. India has committed to supplying 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan, which will be delivered through Pakistan's land route. The grain will be delivered to the UN agency World Food Programme for supply to the Afghan people. The World Food Programme launched the 2022 Global Report on Food Crises on Wednesday in which UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that the war in Ukraine is ""supercharging"" a three-dimensional crisis — food, energy and finance — with devastating impacts on the world's most vulnerable people, countries and economies. ""All this comes at a time when developing countries are already struggling with cascading challenges not of their making — the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis and inadequate resources amidst persistent and growing inequalities,"" he said. The report said that globally, levels of hunger remained alarmingly high. In 2021, they surpassed all previous records as reported by the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC), with close to 193 million people acutely food insecure and in need of urgent assistance across 53 countries/territories. This represents an increase of nearly 40 million people compared to the previous high reached in 2020. The report warned that the outlook for global acute food insecurity in 2022 is expected to deteriorate further relative to 2021. ""In particular, the unfolding war in Ukraine is likely to exacerbate the already severe 2022 acute food insecurity forecasts included in this report, given that the repercussions of the war on global food, energy and fertilizer prices and supplies have not yet been factored into most country-level projection analyses,"" it said. In 2021, almost 70% of the total number of people in crisis or worse or equivalent were found in ten countries/territories: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Yemen, northern Nigeria, the Syrian Arab Republic, Sudan, South Sudan, Pakistan and Haiti. In seven of these, conflict/insecurity was the primary driver of acute food insecurity. The report also added that as Bangladesh continues to grapple with the economic recovery from two years of COVID-19, the war in Ukraine and the accompanying economic impact have had reverberating repercussions across markets from the end of February 2022. Bangladesh imports 10.7% of its total imported food commodities from the Russian Federation and 4.5% from Ukraine. It is one of the world's biggest wheat importers, buying around 6 million tonnes annually, chiefly from India, Canada, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. ","India's wheat production stood at 109.59 million tonnes in the 2020-21 crop year (July-June) India has committed to supplying 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan, which will be delivered through Pakistan's land route .

""The steel manufacturing and mining company operates in sectors of strategic significance to the Government of Russia,"" the government said. ""Today's asset freeze means no UK citizen or company can do business with them."" Britain said Evraz produces 28% of all Russian railway wheels and 97% of rail-tracks in Russia, making it of vital significance as Russia uses rail to move key military supplies and troops to the frontline in Ukraine. Shares in Evraz have been suspended from trading since March 10, when Britain imposed sanctions on Abramovich. The firm said on March 11 that 10 members of its board had quit, leaving only the chief executive.","Evraz produces 28% of all Russian railway wheels and 97% of rail-tracks in Russia .

71," FIFA has received three million ticket requests for the World Cup final in Qatar and high demand to attend some of its biggest group-stage games, even as issues linger about the tiny Persian Gulf nation's ability to accommodate fans. The data revealed to The Associated Press by FIFA shows there have been 2.5 million ticket requests to see Argentina play Mexico on Nov. 26 at the 80,000-capacity Lusail Stadium, and 1.4 million fans hope to see England face the United States the previous day at the 60,000-capacity Al Bayt Stadium. Overall for the Nov. 21-Dec. 18 tournament, there have been more than 2 million ticket requests from the U.S., England and Qatar after the second phase of sales. A random draw will be used to allocate tickets for matches where the demand exceeds capacity. The significant number of ticket requests could reflect the desire to watch more than one match a day with fans looking to fill time between watching their own country by attending other games in a country where all stadiums are within an hour's travel by public transport from the heart of Doha. With all stadiums built around the capital, the tournament lacks the variety of tourist attractions compared to recent World Cups in Brazil and Russia. More than 23 million ticket request have been received overall by FIFA. Accommodating visitors is also challenging given how small the country is with most hotels built around Doha. Hotel aggregation websites show no capacity on the open market for the nights of Nov. 25 and 26 around the Argentina-Mexico and England-U.S. games. There was also no availability showing on the official World Cup accommodation website in hotels, apartments, villas or on the cruise ships docking in Qatar for the tournament. There is also no apparent availability to stay in Doha on the night of the Dec. 18 final at Lusail, the stadium which is yet to stage a test-event match. There have been three million ticket requests for the final despite prices rising up to 46% from the cost for international fans to attend the 2018 final won by France in Moscow, with the most expensive tickets at 5,850 Qatari riyals ($1,607).",FIFA has received three million ticket requests for the World Cup final in Qatar .

 As Prime Minister Narendra Modi embarks on a tour of three European nations, India on May 1 once again called for the cessation of hostilities in Ukraine and resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy, noting that was an appreciation of its position on the crisis by its partner countries. At a media briefing, newly appointed Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra underlined the ""context, clarity, importance and positive dimension"" of India's position on Ukraine and asserted that there should not be any doubt about it. On his first trip abroad this year, Mr. Modi will embark on a three-day visit to Germany, Denmark and France beginning Monday amid the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. ""Our position on Ukraine has been clear. First, there should be a cessation of hostilities; second, a solution must be found out through dialogue and diplomacy,"" he said, adding this view has been conveyed very clearly to various countries. The Foreign Secretary said the visit is focused on expanding India's bilateral ties with the three European nations in a range of areas including trade and investment, clean energy, digital technology and defence, and added that the Ukraine issue will figure in the talks as part of discussions on regional and global developments. He said India's international partners have an understanding of its standpoint on Ukraine and they even have a deep appreciation for it. Mr. Kwatra said discussions on energy security will be one of the key areas of discussion during the Prime Minister's visit as it has assumed greater significance in the current circumstances. There has been a wider debate and discussion in Europe over ending dependence on its reliance on Russian energy in view of its attack on Ukraine. The Foreign Secretary talked about the ""changing elements"" of energy security, its impact on developing countries like India, the challenges in the sector and the mitigation of the challenges. ""I am sure this would constitute one of the elements in the overall discussions. But naturally one single item would not define what the structure of the discussions would be,"" he said. Mr. Kwatra said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will co-chair the 6th India-Germany Inter-Governmental Consultations [IGC] on Monday. It will be followed by a high-level roundtable where Mr. Modi and Mr. Scholz will interact with the top CEOs of both countries. The Prime Minister is also scheduled to interact with the Indian diaspora in Germany. ""The meeting between the two leaders would provide an excellent platform not only to strengthen the existing multi-faceted bilateral partnership but to also shape and develop an ambitious agenda of cooperation for months and years ahead including in the field of the development partnership, green agenda, trade and investment linkages,"" Mr. Kwatra said. The German Chancellor is scheduled to host Mr. Modi at a private dinner. From Germany, Mr. Modi will travel to Copenhagen at the invitation of the Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. He will also participate in the second India-Nordic summit being hosted by Denmark. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and a number of other senior Union ministers are expected to accompany Mr. Modi to Germany as the format of the IGC mandates direct talks between senior ministers from the two sides on cooperation in specific areas. In Denmark, the Prime Minister is scheduled to hold separate bilateral talks with leaders of Norway, Sweeden, Iceland and Finland. ""The Prime Minister's first visit in 2022 factors an ambitious and substantial agenda packed into an intense schedule. The principal purpose of the visit is for India to continue to strengthen its multi-dimensional multi-faceted partnerships with key countries of Europe,"" the Foreign Secretary said. On May 4, Mr. Modi will have a brief stopover in Paris on his return journey where he will hold extensive talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, who was re-elected to the top post last week. ""Narendra Modi's visit to France will provide an opportunity to carry forward high-level engagement between the two countries following the French presidential election,"" Mr. Kwatra said. ""Both countries have continuously nurtured and delivered on the ambition of their strategic partnership,"" he said. Asked whether the Ukraine crisis will figure in his talks with the European leaders, Mr. Kwatra said: ""When the Prime Minister interfaces with the leaders, naturally issues of regional and global importance would also figure in the discussions. But the principal focus of the visit is to structure and strengthen bilateral partnership across a range of areas and exchange perspectives on Ukraine issues."" The Foreign Secretary also said that it would not be correct for him to comment on the position of each of these countries on the Ukraine issue. Reflecting the EU's tough approach in dealing with the Russian aggression, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at the Raisina Dialogue on Monday that Europe will make sure that Moscow's ""unprovoked and unjustified"" aggression against Ukraine will be a ""strategic failure. India has not yet publicly condemned the Russian attack on Ukraine and has been calling for the resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.

73,"Afghanistan's supreme leader appeared publicly for only the second time in six years on Sunday, telling worshippers celebrating Id-ul-Fitr the Taliban had achieved freedom and security since seizing power last year. Speaking just two days after a bomb ripped through a mosque in Kabul, an atmosphere of heightened security surrounded the man introduced as Hibatullah Akhundzada, the chief of the Taliban. ""Congratulations on victory, freedom and success,"" he told thousands of worshippers at the Eidgah mosque in the southern city of Kandahar, the hardline Islamist group's de facto power centre. ""Congratulations on this security and for the Islamic system."" While the number of bombings across the country has dropped since Kabul fell to the Taliban last August, attacks soared over the final two weeks of the fasting month of Ramadan, which ended on Saturday for Afghans. Dozens of civilians have been killed in the primarily sectarian attacks — some claimed by the Islamic State group — targeting members of the Shiite and Sufi Muslim communities.  Friday's bombing of a Sunni mosque in the capital killed at least 10 persons.  Akhundzada delivered his brief address from one of the front rows of worshippers in Kandahar without turning to face the crowd, according to social media posts.  Taliban officials did not allow journalists to approach him, while two helicopters hovered over the mosque for the whole of the two-hour event. Dozens of Taliban fighters were deployed where Akhundzada and other Taliban leaders were sitting and they stopped worshippers from taking their pictures on cellphones. An AFP correspondent who reported from the mosque confirmed that the voice said to be Akhundzada's came from the front rows of worshippers. It was Akhundzada's second known public appearance since taking control of the Taliban in 2016. When the man introduced as the Taliban leader began to speak, worshippers chanted ""Allahu Akbar! Long live Islamic Emirate and Long Live Akhundzada!"" Worshipper Aziz Ahmad Ahmadi said he was overwhelmed. ""I cried when I heard the voice of Sheikh Saheb (Akhundzada)... to hear him is like achieving my biggest dream,"" he said, but added he had failed to spot the leader among the crowd. Another Kandahar resident Bismillah, who attended the Eid prayers at the Eidgah mosque, said, ""I'm so happy that I can't even describe it"". ""I had a dream to pray alongside my supreme leader, to hear his voice or to see him,"" he told AFP.  Akhundzada's low profile has fed speculation about his role in the new Taliban government, formed after the group took control of Kabul on August 15 — and even rumours of his death. His public profile has largely been limited to the release of messages during Islamic holidays from his office in Kandahar. In October, Akhundzada visited the Darul Uloom Hakimiah mosque in the southern city, according to an audio recording circulated by Taliban social media accounts. On Friday, in a message released ahead of Id-ul-Fitr, he made no mention of the bloodshed that had rocked Afghanistan over Ramzan, instead praising the Taliban's building of ""a strong Islamic and national army"" and ""strong intelligence organisation"". In Kabul, Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund held Id prayers at the palace, where he slammed Washington for intervening in Afghanistan's internal affairs. ""Didn't they (Washington) withhold the wealth of this country which was in its bank? Isn't that intervention in this country?"" Akhund said in a statement released by the authorities. Washington seized billions of dollars of Afghanistan's assets after it withdrew in August, deepening a humanitarian crisis in the country. Many Afghans in Kabul preferred to stay indoors on Sunday rather than pray at mosques after the recent deadly attacks. ""The situation of our people is very sad, especially after what happened in the mosques,"" Kabul resident Ahmad Shah Hashemi told AFP. ""Many young and old people have been martyred. The people of Afghanistan have nothing but sorrow."" The deadliest attack during Ramadan was in the northern province of Kunduz, where a bomb ripped through a mosque as a group of Sufis performed rituals. At least 36 people were killed and scores more were wounded. No group has so far claimed that attack.","Afghanistan's supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada appeared publicly for only the second time in six years .

74,"Facing production issues due to supply chain challenges, leading carmakers Maruti Suzuki (MSI) and Hyundai Motor reported a dip in vehicle dispatches from factories to dealers in April this year. Tata Motors, Toyota Kirloskar Motor and Skoda Auto on the other hand witnessed a robust growth in vehicle dispatches last month. The country's largest carmaker MSI said its domestic sales slipped 7% to 1,32,248 units as against 1,42,454 units in April 2021.

MG Motor India said its retail sales declined 22% to 2,008 units last month compared to 2,565 in April 2021. The production remained volatile and immensely impacted by the global supply chain constraints due to the sudden and new COVID-19 lockdowns in different parts of the world, the automaker stated.

In view of the World Labour Day, rallies and public meetings were conducted across Dakshina Kannada and Udupi district on Sunday. Addressing the labourers, Centre for Indian Trade Union District Secretary Sunil Bajal said that labourers should fight unitedly against anti labour policies of the Central and the State Governments. The governments are favouring corporate firms and diluting provisions of many labour Acts.  ""Governments are raising issues like hijab, halal, azaan and other communally sensitive issues to divert attention of workmen. We should not be carried away but fight in unison against such regressive policies,"" he said. Labourers should take the lead in protecting the country from the neo-liberal policies. Senior labour activist Sukumar said labourers should fight against exploitation of natural resources by the corporate firms. The Central Government is set to bring changes in the laws to make labourers work for 14 hours and make the eight hours work rule, which was the product of agitation in Chicago, obsolete.     All India Bank Officers Association Secretary K.

The ISMC is set to fully implement the project over a period of seven years with a potential to generate 1,500 high-tech jobs, besides over 10,000 indirect and ancillary jobs. Sanjeev K. Gupta, CEO, Karnataka Digital Economy Mission, told The Hindu that availability of natural resource of water and power and the talented or skilled manpower that Mysuru produced were critical factors that tilted the scales in the city's favour. Observers said the decision to bring investment and the semiconductor plant to Mysuru was also reckoned to be one of the biggest success of Beyond Bengaluru, a Government of Karnataka initiative to take industries beyond the capital city, which is saturated besides resulting in lopsided development. With this, the Government had ensured that future-tech goes beyond Bengaluru and there was even development, they added.  Mr. Gupta said the Government was driving the Beyond Bengaluru concept wholeheartedly for ensuring an even growth of Karnataka in which every part of the State should develop and Mysuru emerged as an important place in this mission. The Beyond Bengaluru concept envisages promoting emerging technology clusters to rest of Karnataka and this is the biggest success of the initiative so far.  Minister for Higher Education C.N.

77,"The High Court has directed the Delhi government to take a decision on a complaint against a private school for allegedly charging an excessive fine on delayed payment of tuition fees within six weeks. Hearing a petition by Ajay Aggarwal, father of two students studying in classes 12 and 8 in the school, Justice Rekha Palli directed the Department of Education to decide the petitioner's complaint by passing a ""reasoned and speaking"" order in accordance with the laid down procedure and principles of natural justice. In case the petitioner is aggrieved by any order passed by the authorities, Mr. Aggarwal could seek legal recourse as permissible in law, the judge said. The counsel for the Delhi government told the court that the authorities will examine the petitioner's complaint and expeditiously pass an order. Mr. Aggarwal claimed that the private school in question indulged in ""unethical practices"", including levying excessive late fines on delayed payment of tuition fees, which was in utter violation of the Delhi School Education Rules (DSER). In his petition, the father of two said despite being fully aware of the law, the private school stated that ""a late fee of Rs 50 per day [including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays] will be levied after the due date."" ""That the misdeeds of the respondent no.3 in levying late fee fine of more than 5 paise per day is not only in violation of Rule 166 of the DSER, 1973 but is also tantamount to exploitation of parents and commercialisation of education which is impermissible in law,"" stated the petition.

78," Mino Raiola, the influential and often controversial sports agent to some of soccer's biggest players, has died. He was 54. Raiola died after a long illness, his family confirmed on Saturday. He had been undergoing treatment at Milan's San Raffaele hospital, where he was visited by Zlatan Ibrahimović this week. Raiola underwent surgery in January but it was said at the time that it was not life-threatening. ""In infinite sorrow we share the passing of the most caring and amazing football agent that ever was,"" read a post from ""The Raiola Family"" on his social media accounts. ""Mino fought until the end with the same strength he put on negotiation tables to defend our players. As usual, Mino made us proud and never realized it."" Raiola was the agent of stars such as Erling Haaland and Paul Pogba, as well as Ibrahimović. He was famous for getting his players big-money moves but also drew the ire of soccer managers, including Alex Ferguson after he negotiated Pogba's transfer from Manchester United to Juventus in 2012. He also dealt with Pogba's return to United in 2016 for a then-world-record fee of 105 million euros (then $116 million) of which Raiola earned 27 million euros ($30 million). He was paid millions more by Pogba and United. Raiola was in the process of negotiating Haaland's expected move away from Borussia Dortmund this summer, with Manchester City one of several possible destinations for the Norwegian starlet. Raiola also oversaw the departure of Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma from childhood club AC Milan to Paris Saint-Germain last year. Mario Balotelli was another of his clients. ""Mino touched so many lives through his work and wrote a new chapter in the history of modern football. His presence will forever be missed,"" added the announcement of his death. ""Mino's mission of making football a better place for players will continue with the same passion."" Italian and international media widely reported on Thursday that Raiola had died but that was categorically denied to The Associated Press by his agency and later refuted apparently by Raiola himself on social media. ""Current health status for the ones wondering: p(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk)d off second time in 4 months they kill me. Seem also able to resuscitate,"" read a message on Raiola's Twitter account. It was also wrongly reported he had died in January when he was taken to the hospital for what were later confirmed as ""ordinary medical checks that require anesthesia."" Raiola was born in the southern Italian city of Nocera Inferiore but moved to the Netherlands after less than a year. He worked as a waiter in his father's Italian restaurant while at high school and went on to study law for two years at university. Raiola was a youth team soccer player and administrator before starting his career as a sports agent by assisting in the transfer of Dutch players to foreign clubs. He was rarely far from controversy or the limelight — much like several of the players he represented. Raiola compared FIFA to a mafia organization in 2013 and called the governing body's then-president Sepp Blatter a ""demented dictator."" Along with fellow ""super agents"" Jorge Mendes and Jonathan Barnett, Raiola threatened FIFA with legal action over plans for a cap on transfer payments in 2020.","Mino Raiola dies after a long illness, his family confirms .

79,"The role of ""animal reservoirs"" in the spread of COVID-19 is still being studied but evidence of zoonosis, or the virus jumping from animals to humans, is growing and scientists are concerned that this new frontier could potentially spawn dangerous, and difficult to monitor mutants. Some experts supported the theory that the highly mutated Omicron variant, which caused a deluge of cases globally, including India, emerged from animals, potentially rodents, rather than an immune-compromised human. ""As the virus multiplies in infected hosts, it can mutate slightly, and the worry is that over time, minor genomic tweaks in hundreds or thousands, if not millions, of animals, could eventually add up to changes that make the virus more contagious or deadlier in people, or able to evade treatments and vaccines,"" US-based public health expert Amita Gupta told PTI. Although the number of people infected with coronavirus variants evolved in animals has not been quantified yet, the evidence of zoonosis is growing. Last week, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that at least four people in Michigan, U.S., were infected with a version of the coronavirus observed mostly in minks during the first year of the pandemic. Flagging the concern, the World Health Organization (WHO) last month said the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to wildlife could result in the establishment of animal reservoirs of the virus.

80,"The government was working to draft laws not only in sound legal terminology but also in popular language that makes it easy for citizens to understand the law, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday. He also urged State governments to repeal ""obsolete and archaic laws"".  Addressing the inaugural session of a joint conference of Chief Ministers and Chief Justices of High Courts, he pointed out that nearly three-and-half lakh undertrials were in jails for petty offences, and appealed to the Chief Ministers and Chief Justices to give priority to such cases so that such prisoners could be released on bail. ""I would appeal to all of them to give priority to these matters on the basis of humanitarian sensibility and the law."" The Prime Minister talked about the need to use local languages in courts, stressed on moving towards digital delivery of justice systems, importance of mediation and reiterated his government's effort to improve judicial infrastructure and judicial strength. Apart from Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana, Supreme Court judges, Chief Justices of High Courts and Law Minister Kiren Rijiju, several Chief Ministers attended the meet.  West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Delhi's Arvind Kejriwal, Chhattisgarh's Bhupesh Baghel, Jharkhand's Hemant Soren, Assam's Himanta Biswa Sarma and Punjab's Bhagwant Mann were among those who participated in the conference.  Appealing to the State governments to repeal archaic laws, Mr. Modi observed, ""In 2015, we identified about 1,800 laws which had become irrelevant/obsolete. Out of these, 1,450 such laws of the Centre were abolished. But only 75 such laws have been abolished by the States"". The Prime Minister said 75 years of Independence have continuously clarified the roles and responsibilities of both the judiciary and the executive, and wherever it was necessary, the relationship had evolved continuously to give directions to the country ""In our country, while the role of the judiciary is that of the guardian of the Constitution, the legislature represents the aspirations of the citizens. I believe that the confluence and balance of these two branches will prepare the road map for an effective and time-bound judicial delivery system in the country,"" he stated. Speaking after Justice Ramana, who had earlier suggested ""Indianisation"" of courts by using regional and local languages, Mr. Modi carried forward the theme and noted that the government was working on drafting legislations in two formats -- one in typical legal language and the other in simple language which could be understood by ordinary people. The practice was followed in several countries and both the formats were considered as legally acceptable, he stressed.  ""We need to encourage local languages in courts. This will not only increase the confidence of common citizens in the justice system but they will feel more connected to it,"" he said. Referring to Justice Ramana's speech, he remarked, ""newspapers have got a positive headline"". The focus should be on what kind of a legal system the country aspired for by 2047 when it completes 100 years of its Independence. ""Our vision in Amrit Kaal should be of such a judicial system in which there is easy justice, speedy justice, and justice for all,"" he stated.  Talking about using technologies in judiciary, he gave the example of success of digital transactions in small towns and villages and asserted that 40 percent of global digital transactions last year was from India.  Mr. Modi noted that law schools of many countries now taught subjects such as Blockchains, Electronic Discovery, Cybersecurity, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Bioethics. ""It is our responsibility that in our country also, legal education should be according to these international standards,"" he said. Delivering the welcome address, Mr. Rijiju said the conference provided for an honest and constructive dialogue between the judiciary and the government for an efficient delivery of justice.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke at joint conference of Chief Ministers and Chief Justices of High Courts .

84," The best way to deal with the conflict in Ukraine would be to focus on ""stopping the fighting and getting the talking"" to move forward and India's position on the crisis is best placed to advance such an approach, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said on April 27. His comments came in response to a question at an interactive session at the Raisina Dialogue, India's premier foreign policy and geo-economics conference. Mr. Jaishankar on April 26 countered criticism of India's position on Russia's actions in Ukraine, saying the Western powers have been oblivious to the pressing challenges in Asia including last year's developments in Afghanistan. ""We spent a lot of time yesterday on Ukraine and I have tried to explain what our views are but also explained that in our minds the best way forward is to focus on stopping the fighting, getting the talking and finding ways of moving forward. We think our choices, our positions are best placed to advance that,"" he said. India has not yet publicly condemned the Russian attack on Ukraine and has been calling for the resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy. In his address, Mr. Jaishankar talked about India's 75-year-long journey after Independence and highlighted how the country played a key role in promoting democracy in South Asia. Reflecting on areas where India came up short, the External Affairs Minister listed a lack of adequate attention to human resources and manufacturing and mentioned that probably not much attention was given to hard security as part of foreign policy. Asked about what should be the priority for the country in the next 25 years, Mr. Jaishankar said capability development in all possible areas should be the central focus. ""We have to be confident about who we are. I think it is better to engage the world on the basis of who we are...This idea that others define us, somehow we need to get the approval of other quarters, I think that is an era we need to put behind us,"" Mr. Jaishankar said. He hoped that India will be ""deeply more international"" in terms of its commitments, responsibilities and roles in the next 25 years. ""We should not be looking at the world with a sense of entitlement. We need to earn our place in the world and which, to a certain extent, therefore, comes to the issue of how the world benefits from the growth of India. We need to demonstrate that "" he said. The External Affairs Minister was asked what India expects from the world. ""There is a lot of talk about reliable and resilient supply chains and people speak about transparency and trusted technologies. If India could do more and show the rest of the world that the world benefits by India being bigger,"" Mr. Jaishankar said. ""So we need to develop stakes in our future whether the rest of the world is concerned. I think some of that is happening for strategic reasons obviously, but we need to make more of it happen especially for economic reasons,"" he added. Showcasing India's 75-year-long successful democratic journey, Mr. Jaishankar said the choices made by India have had a larger influence globally. ""There was a time in this part of the world that we were pretty much the only democracy. If democracy is global today, we see it is global today, I think, in some measure, that credit is due to India,"" Mr. Jaishankar said. He noted that it is also fair to look back on where the country came up short. ""One, clearly we did not pay the kind of attention to our social indicators, our human resources as we should have. Two, we did not concentrate on manufacturing and technology strengths as we should have. And three, in terms of foreign policy, probably, in the mix of various elements, we did not give as much importance, as much weight to hard security as we should have,"" he said. The External Affairs Minister said India contributed to the spreading of democracy in South Asia. ""We would like to see more prosperity in South Asia. If India has been in a sense example of democracy or promoter of democracy in South Asia, we would now like to be part of a larger lifting tide so that the rest of South Asia grows along with us,"" Mr. Jaishankar said. Asked about the shortage of wheat in the wake of the war in Ukraine and if India would like to contribute to addressing the issue. ""We have a significant wheat production.

Reflecting on the first half of the season, Ponting said, ""I've said it a few times this year where there are 36 or 37 overs of really good stuff, and we just let it slip for two or three overs. ""And, that's the difference in these games. We sort of gear ourselves to not overtrain in the first part of the season, try and build up along the way. But our performances have been win one, lose one, win one. So, we need to start getting that little bit of momentum.""

""Things didn't go well in the game, we had a drama at the end. But, it's nice to be back outside again."" Sharing his experience of watching the team's previous match from quarantine, Ponting said, ""It was frustrating.

87," U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Russian President Vladimir Putin met one-on-one Tuesday for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine, and the United Nations said they agreed on arranging evacuations from a besieged steel plant in the battered city of Mariupol. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the Russian leader and U.N. chief discussed ""proposals for humanitarian assistance and evacuation of civilians from conflict zones, namely in relation to the situation in Mariupol."" They also agreed in principle, he said, that the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross should be involved in the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal steel complex where Ukrainian defenders in the southeastern city are making a dogged stand. Discussions will be held with the U.N. humanitarian office and the Russian Defence Ministry on the evacuation, Mr. Dujarric said. During the meeting, which the U.N. said lasted nearly two hours, Mr. Putin and Mr. Guterres sat at opposite ends of a long white table in a room with gold curtains bordered in red. No one else was at the table. Mr. Guterres criticized Russia's military action in Ukraine as a flagrant violation of its neighbor's territorial integrity and urged Russia to allow the evacuation of civilians trapped at the steel mill. Mr. Putin responded by claiming that Russian troops have offered humanitarian corridors to civilians holed up at the plant. But, he said, the Ukrainian defenders of the plant were using civilians as shields and not allowing them to leave. The sprawling Azovstal site has been almost completely destroyed by Russian attacks, but it is the last pocket of organized Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol. An estimated 2,000 soldiers and 1,000 civilians are said to be holed up in fortified positions underneath the wrecked structures. In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday ahead of Mr. Guterres' visit, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba noted the failure of other foreign officials who visited Moscow to achieve results, and he urged the U.N. chief to press Russia for an evacuation of Mariupol. ""This is really something that the U.N. is capable to do,"" Mr. Kuleba said. Mr. Guterres flew to Rzeszow, Poland, from Moscow late Tuesday and was met by Polish President Andrzej Duda. He is to go to Kyiv for meetings Thursday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Mr. Kuleba, and his meeting with Mr. Putin is expected to top the agenda. Many analysts have low expectations for Mr. Guterres' diplomatic foray into the Ukraine war. But U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq was unusually optimistic Monday ahead of the Moscow meetings, telling reporters Guterres ""thinks there is an opportunity now"" and ""will make the most"" of his time on the ground talking to the leaders and see what can be achieved. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, Guterres has accused the Russians of violating the U.N. Charter, which calls for peaceful settlement of disputes. He also has repeatedly called for a cessation of hostilities, most recently appealing unsuccessfully last Tuesday for a four-day ""humanitarian pause"" leading up to the Orthodox Easter holiday on Sunday.  The U.N. crisis coordinator in Ukraine, Amin Awad, followed up Sunday by calling for an immediate halt to fighting in Mariupol to allow an estimated 100,000 trapped civilians to evacuate. Mr. Guterres said at a news conference after meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov earlier Tuesday that safe and effective humanitarian corridors are urgently needed to evacuate civilians and deliver aid. To deal with ""the crisis within a crisis in Mariupol,"" he proposed coordination between the U.N., Red Cross, and Ukrainian and Russian forces to enable the evacuation of civilians who want to leave ""both inside and outside the Azovstal plant and in the city, in any direction they choose, and to deliver the humanitarian aid required."" The U.N. chief also proposed establishing a Humanitarian Contact Group comprising Russia, Ukraine and the United Nations ""to look for opportunities for the opening of safe corridors, with local cessations of hostilities, and to guarantee that they are actually effective."" Mr. Dujarric made no mention of a broader evacuation of civilians from Mariupol or Guterres' Humanitarian Contact Group, but getting civilians out of the steel plant would be an important step. On Saturday, a Ukrainian military unit released a video reportedly taken two days earlier in which women and children holed up underground in the plant, some for as long as two months, said they longed to see the sun.",U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine .

An estimated 2,000 soldiers and 1,000 civilians are said to be holed up in fortified positions underneath the wrecked structures.

He asked them to take steps to ensure the delivery of government schemes on the ground. In line with the government's reform agenda, several presentations including on rationalisation of autonomous bodies and decriminalisation of certain minor offences were made by senior bureaucrats in the Union Council of Ministers' meeting chaired by the Prime Minister.  In total, five presentations were made in the meeting which lasted for nearly four hours.  The topics of the presentation included 75 'Amrit Sarovars' in every district, implementation of 2022-23 budget announcements, rationalisation of autonomous bodies, decriminalisation of offences and capacity building commission, the sources said.  Mr. Modi specifically told the Ministers that the budget allocated to their ministries should be fully utilised, while ensuring the last-mile delivery of government schemes, the sources said.  He told the Ministers that they should have comprehensive knowledge about issues related to governance and policy, going beyond their respective ministries, they said.  In the meeting, the Prime Minister also suggested that the Ministers meet once in six weeks to discuss governance issues, the sources added.  The Amrit Sarovar initiative is a part of the government's water conservation measures.

91,"The friendship between Russia and China has ""no limits"", President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said here on Monday.  Addressing the inaugural session at the annual Raisina Dialogue, which was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister Dr S. Jaishankar, she condemned the Russian aggression in Ukraine but also supported the need to find a ""diplomatic solution"" to the crisis. Ms. von der Leyen highlighted the common links like democracy and the rule of law that bind European states and India. ""They have declared that the friendship between them has 'no limits'; that there are 'no forbidden areas of cooperation; this was in February this year. And then, the invasion of Ukraine followed. What can we expect from the 'new international relations' that both have called for?"" asked Ms von der Leyen, who described the current relation between Russia and China as an ""unrestrained pact"". The top diplomat of the European Commission recollected her recent visit to Ukraine where she witnessed the ravages of the ongoing conflict and expressed Europe's collective determination to ensure ""strategic failure"" of Russia in Ukraine.  She clarified that the strategy to impose sanctions on Russia is not a ""standalone solution"". ""They are embedded in a broader strategy that has diplomatic and security elements. And this is why we have designed the sanctions in a way to sustain them over a longer period of time. Because this gives us leverage to achieve a diplomatic solution that will bring lasting peace,"" she said. Indicating Russia's strong ties with China, Ms. von der Leyen argued that the violence in Ukraine is generating ripples in the Indo-Pacific region. ""China is a negotiating partner, an economic competitor and a systemic rival. We will continue to cooperate on tackling common challenges, and we will protect our essential interests and promote our values,"" said Ms. von der Leyen who earlier in the day met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and held a discussion with External Affairs Minister Dr S. Jaishankar. The visiting top official of the European Commission paid tributes to the democratic tradition of India and said that the ""world watches with admiration"" whenever India holds the general elections every five years. ""Democracy was born more than 2,000 years ago in Europe. But today, its largest home is India,"" Ms. von der Leyen said. The top representative of the European Commission said both India and the European Union share common interests in maintaining ""safe trading routes, in seamless supply chains, and in a free and open Indo-Pacific."" Ms. von der Leyen projected India and the European Union as part of the global group that supports rule of law and urged stronger partnership between the EU and the ASEAN countries. Earlier in the day, Mr Modi received Ms von der Leyen and exchanged ideas on the strategy to combat climate change and build closer partnership in areas like Green Hydrogen. The Ministry of External Affairs, in an official press statement, said the two leaders discussed the progress in the India-EU Strategic Partnership, including the forthcoming re-commencement of negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement and Investment Agreement. Both sides also agreed to start a high-level trade and Technology Commission that will increase coordination between the political leadership and other stakeholders. ""The EU has only one Trade and Technology Council (commission) and that is with the U.S. and I think, therefore, it is telling that it was so important for us to put up a second... with India,"" she said.","Ursula von der Leyen condemned the Russian aggression in Ukraine but also supported the need to find a ""diplomatic solution"" to the crisis .

92,"Women's Tennis Association chief Steve Simon has warned Wimbledon organisers and Britain's tennis body of ""strong reactions"" to their decision to ban players from Russia and Belarus to compete in tournaments. The All England Club (AELTC), which organises the grasscourt major, and the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) will not allow Russian and Belarusian players to compete in events in the United Kingdom due to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The move was slammed by the ATP, which runs the men's tour, and the WTA as ""discriminatory"", with the world governing bodies said they were evaluating sanctions in response. Simon told The Tennis Podcast that the Wimbledon decision was against Grand Slam rules and the agreement they have with the tournament while the LTA, which has WTA sanctioned events, violated the bylaws and rules regarding athlete entry. ""We don't have the same jurisdiction over the Grand Slams as we do (over) our own sanctioned events. We have precedents ... where these situations may have occurred where fines and tournament sanctions have been imposed,"" Simon said. ""I do think that you'll see some strong reactions that will come from us but what those are and how far they'll go is still to be determined."" Tennis governing bodies have banned Russia and Belarus from international team competitions following the invasion, but individual players from the two countries are allowed to compete on their respective tours as neutrals. Simon said both the ATP and the WTA are in discussions over the issue but the decisions will be independent. The AELTC, in its statement announcing the decision, said it had to play its part in the efforts of government, industry, sporting and creative institutions to ""limit Russia's global influence through the strongest means possible"". ""People take the position that sports and politics shouldn't match and shouldn't be intertwined, but that's not the reality,"" Simon said. ""At times sports does cross into politics and here is a situation where politics is crossing into sports. It is real life. ""The one thing that this sport has always agreed upon, we don't agree on a lot of things, but the one thing we have always been united on was that entry into our events ... has always been based up on merit and without discrimination.""

93," The initial public offering (IPO) of the country's largest insurer LIC will open on May 4 and close on May 9, sources said.  The IPO, through which the government will sell 3.5% stake in the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), will fetch ₹21,000 crore to the exchequer.  The IPO values LIC at ₹6 lakh crore.  The government had in February planned to sell 5% stake, or 31.6 crore shares, in the insurance behemoth and had filed draft papers with SEBI. However, the IPO plans faced headwinds from the ongoing market volatility due to the Russia-Ukraine war.  Last week, the government decided to lower the issue size to 3.5%. The government has also filed papers with SEBI seeking exemption from the 5% stake sale norm, sources said.  As the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) norms, companies with valuation over ₹ 1 lakh crore have to sell 5% stake in IPO.  LIC's embedded value, which is a measure of the consolidated shareholders value in an insurance company, was pegged at about ₹5.4 lakh crore as of September 30, 2021, by international actuarial firm Milliman Advisors.  Based on investor feedback, the market value of government-owned LIC has been pegged at 1.1 times its embedded value or ₹6 lakh crore.  LIC IPO would contribute a major chunk to the budgeted disinvestment proceeds in the current fiscal. The government has pegged disinvestment receipts at ₹65,000 crore in the current financial year, up from ₹13,531 crore mopped up last fiscal.

94,"Saying religious freedom conditions in India had ""significantly worsened"" in 2021, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), a bipartisan, independent body, recommended, for the third year in a row, that India be designated a 'Country of Particular Concern' (CPC), i.e., the category of governments performing most poorly on religious freedom criteria.  The State Department, which has its own Office of International Religious Freedom, is not bound by the Commission's recommendations and has not accepted the CPC recommendation for India for the two years. ""During the year, the Indian government escalated its promotion and enforcement of policies — including those promoting a Hindu-nationalist agenda — that negatively affect Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Dalits, and other religious minorities,"" the report said. ""The government continued to systemize its ideological vision of a Hindu state at both the national and state levels through the use of both existing and new laws and structural changes hostile to the country's religious minorities."" The report section on India said that the government had ""repressed critical voices"", especially minority communities and individuals reporting on them. It mentions the arrest of rights activist Khuran Pervez in Kashmir, and the July 2021 death of octogenarian Father Stan Swamy, arrested in October 2020 under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The report touches on challenges faced by Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs), especially with regard to foreign funding. It also highlights anti-conversion laws. ""In October 2021, Karnataka's government ordered a survey of churches and priests in the state and authorized police to conduct a door-to-door inspection to find Hindus who have converted to Christianity,"" the report said. Other countries recommended for the CPC designation were: Afghanistan, Nigeria, Syria and Vietnam. USCIRF recommended that the State Department redesignate Myanmar, China, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan as CPCs. The government has, previously, pushed back against the USCIRF's grading, questioning its locus standi. In 2020, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar called the Commission an ""Organisation of Particular Concern."" Mr Jaishankar, who was in Washington two weeks ago for the 2+2 U.S.-India defence and foreign ministry dialogue, said that the state of human rights in India had not been raised at the dialogue.

Kamaljeet Gill, president, Sarvodaya Drivers' Association of Delhi, which represents drivers attached to ride-hailing apps such as Ola and Uber, said the strike would continue on Wednesday as well.  Mr. Gill said that leaders of various drivers' unions met the Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot on Tuesday but were not satisfied with the response of the government. ""The success of the call for strike was evident on the streets today. In our meeting, Mr. Gahlot asked us for 10 days to come up with a solution. We were not satisfied with this response and decided to continue our strike on Wednesday,"" he added.  The protesting drivers' unions had last week given the Union and Delhi governments an ultimatum demanding a reduction in CNG, petrol and diesel prices and regulation of fares. According to drivers' associations, the earnings from the ride-hailing apps have reduced to ₹6 per km at the time of soaring fuel prices. At the same time, the cab aggregator firms charge a commission of 25% from the drivers on each trip. Meanwhile, some cabs continued to operate in the city despite the call for strike by the drivers' unions. Mr. Gill said the unions had not forced all drivers to join the strike. ""Some drivers in urgent need of money decided not to be a part of the strike. They are free to ferry commuters but most of us feel we must take this battle to its conclusion for the larger good,"" he said. ""I was able to book a cab to the airport at a reasonable price. When I asked, the driver told me he was unaware of the strike,"" said Rajvir Singh, a resident of Defence Colony. However, some other commuters were not as fortunate. ""My wife and I needed to travel to a hospital in central Delhi for a doctor's appointment. We tried to book a cab but couldn't get any for half an hour,"" said Sandeep Bajaj, a resident of Gurgaon. ""Finally, when we did get a driver, he was several kilometres away from our location. We ended up being late for our appointment by two hours,"" he added. Prema Basu, a south Delhi resident, said she had to give up her plans to go office after not being able to find a cab for several hours. ""There were no drivers near my location whenever I tried to book a ride. So, I just gave up,"" she said.","Delhi-NCR commuters faced inconvenience for the second successive day due to a strike called by various drivers' unions .

106,"Citing increased demand for sleeper buses, the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) is all set to convert around 100 multi-axle seater AC buses into sleeper buses.

""After Dream Class luxury buses were introduced, there was a surge in demand for the sleeper buses. Passengers travelling on long routes are looking for comfortable travel. After the outbreak of the pandemic too, there has been continued demand for sleeper berths. While booking tickets, people first opt for sleeper buses. If they do not get sleeper, then they go for seater buses. Considering the increasing trend, the corporation has decided to convert seater buses to sleeper buses,"" said an official.  At present, the KSRTC has a fleet size of 936 premier service buses, including 140 non AC sleeper, 36 AC and 42 Dream Class buses. A majority of the premier service buses are seater buses. As per the tender documents, minimum 34 berths will be provided in each bus, and provisions will be made for emergency exits. After the outbreak of COVID-19, the KSRTC had suspended induction of new buses to lessen the financial burden. The officials opine that conversion of existing fleet to sleeper buses is likely to be economical and also help meet the growing demand. For more than two years, a majority of the premier services remained off the roads as the KSRTC could not run the buses due to lockdowns and travel restrictions on inter state routes. ""After a long gap, we are seeing a gradual surge in demand for premier services. Our Bengaluru division for the first time in two years operated all the premier services on Thursday.

107," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to arrive in India next week, soon after the long Easter break in the U.K., with a state visit that highlights a successful India-U.K. partnership on the agenda besides a wide-ranging schedule in New Delhi, according to highly-placed Indian government sources.  The visit next week, which is yet to be formally announced by Downing Street, follows the successful completion of four out of 26 chapters in the ongoing India-U.K. free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Johnson are expected to take stock of the negotiations and mandate a timeline for the possible completion of the process, initially set for the end of this year.  According to officials close to the discussions, there has also been ""significant progress"" in the remaining 22 chapters of the FTA at the end of the first two rounds of official negotiations, with the third round of talks scheduled for later this month.  The focal point of Mr. Johnson's India visit is expected to be on April 21 and 22, when bilateral discussions and interactions with Indian business leaders are on the cards. A joint statement, being worked on by both sides, is likely to cover agreements across a variety of sectors, including defence and security and education.  The Russia-Ukraine conflict is likely to feature strongly during the meeting, but officials pointed out that other regional matters such as the situation in Afghanistan and the U.K.'s Indo-Pacific tilt will be high on the agenda of the bilateral visit.  The officials maintain that discussions with the U.K. over India's stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict have remained ""cordial"", with a respect for New Delhi's hopes of a peaceful resolution through diplomatic means.  Closer defence ties that overcome some ""legacy issues"" around technology transfer and make use of the 'Make in India' initiative are seen as an important aspect of future India-U.K. relations, against the backdrop of India's historic defence equipment ties with Russia. Mr. Modi and Mr. Johnson last met in person on the sidelines of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November last year, when their talks during the World Leaders' Summit focussed on the India-U.K. climate partnership as well as a review of the 2030 Roadmap the pair had signed during a virtual summit in May 2021.  The Roadmap, which aims to at least double bilateral trade between India and the U.K. by 2030, has been dubbed a comprehensive agreement that prioritises areas where the two countries are ""natural partners"". Mr. Johnson's expected visit next week is seen as long overdue, having been cancelled twice before – first when he was invited as a chief guest for Republic Day celebrations due to a COVID-19 spike in the U.K. in early 2021 and then cancelled again as a result of the pandemic situation in India around this time last year.

108," Prince Harry and wife Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have met Queen Elizabeth II after flying into the U.K. from the U.S. The royal couple, who are now based in California after stepping back from frontline British royalty in 2020, haven't seen Harry's 95-year-old grandmother for two years. They decided to make the stop on Thursday, on their way to the Hague for the Invictus Games ceremony being led by Prince Harry this weekend. Earlier on Thursday, Buckingham Palace said the Queen will not attend the traditional Easter Sunday service at St George's Chapel in Windsor. The monarch, who is due to celebrate her 96th birthday next week on April 21, has been experiencing mobility issues. A spokesperson for Harry confirmed earlier in March that he would miss the memorial service for his grandfather, Prince Philip, but that he hoped to visit the Queen soon. The 37-year-old is bringing a claim against the U.K. Home Office after being told he would no longer be given the same degree of personal protective security when visiting from the U.S., despite offering to pay for it himself. Harry wants to bring his children, Archie, 2, and 10-month-old Lilibet, to visit, but he and his family are ""unable to return to his home"" because it is too dangerous, his legal representative has said. The couple are on their way to the Invictus Games in the Netherlands, which will take place from April 16 to 22. A film crew is expected to be joining the couple at the games as part of filming for a Netflix series called 'Heart Of Invictus'. Prince Harry founded the games to aid the rehabilitation of injured or sick military personnel and veterans from across the globe.

110,"Nepal is running low on foreign currency reserves needed to import medicines, oil products, cars and a range of other items, and will run out in seven months if things don't improve, a central bank official said on Friday. The central bank has increased interest rates, hoping it will discourage people from buying imports and help extend the foreign reserves, said Gunakar Bhatta, spokesperson of Nepal Rastriya Bank, the central bank. ""We are concerned about the sustainability of our foreign exchange reserves,"" Mr. Bhatta said. But he said there already are signs that the situation is getting better with the slowing of the pandemic. More tourists have begun to arrive and increasing numbers of Nepalese are going abroad to earn foreign currency and send it back home, he said.  ""Compared to previous years, the foreign exchange reserve level has come down, but we can manage it because the number of migrant workers that are going abroad has increased,"" Mr. Bhatta said. Nepal's main sources of foreign currency are tourism, remittances from overseas workers and foreign aid. Normally, hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists visit Nepal every year. However, the number declined sharply due to restrictions imposed during the coronavirus pandemic. Tourists are trickling back, with hundreds of climbers already applying to climb the world's highest peaks and thousands more trekking on mountain trails. Nepal has few exports and imports almost everything from abroad. Motor vehicles and oil products account for one fourth of the imports, Mr. Bhatta said. The Finance Ministry said earlier this week that the government is working to reduce imports of gold and luxury goods, but did not provide details.","Nepal's main sources of foreign currency are tourism, remittances from overseas workers and foreign aid .

113,"The World Health Organisation has said that it is continuing to monitor ""several descendent lineages"" of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, including two new sublineages that have additional mutations associated with potential ""immune escape characteristics."" The COVID-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update, released by WHO on Tuesday, said that the Omicron variant remains the dominant variant circulating globally. WHO said it continues to monitor several descendent lineages under the Omicron Variant of Concern, including BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 as well as now BA.4 and BA.5. It also includes BA.1/BA.2 circulating recombinant forms, such as XE. ""A small number of sequences of BA.4 and BA.5 descendent lineages have now been detected in a few countries. Both have additional mutations in the Spike region (S:L452R, S:F486V) and unique mutations outside of Spike. The S:L452R and S:F486V mutations are associated with potential immune escape characteristics,"" the global health organisation said. It added that it is working with scientists to further assess the characteristics of these lineages and their public health implications. ""WHO recommends countries to continue surveillance, where possible, and rapid data sharing on publicly available databases."" According to WHO, the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to evolve. With such intense transmission worldwide, further variants, including recombinants, will emerge. ""This is expected."" WHO is tracking the two new sublineages (BA.4 and BA.5) as part of the Omicron variant. These variants have additional mutations that need to be further studied to understand their impact on immune escape potential. Only a few dozen sequences of these variants have been reported from a handful of countries. WHO is working with scientists to better understand their current spread as well as any potential impact they may have. WHO said that Omicron's properties of immune escape have been associated with the rapid and almost synchronous increase in the global incidence of COVID-19 cases reported until the end of January 2022. A further increase observed at the beginning of March was driven primarily by a delayed increase in case incidences in the Western Pacific Region and a rebound in the number of new cases reported in the European Region. ""This trend was likely due to a combination of factors, including the predominance of the Omicron Pango lineages BA.1, and then BA.2, with a transmission advantage over other Omicron lineages; relaxation of public health and social measures (PHSM); and waning of humoral immunity following vaccination and/or prior infection,"" it said. ""The recent detection of emerging recombinants of the Delta-Omicron and Omicron descendent lineages requires ongoing close monitoring."" The WHO update added that globally, during the week of April 4 through 10, the number of new COVID-19 cases and deaths has continued to decline for a third consecutive week, with over 7 million cases and over 22,000 deaths reported, a decrease of 24 per cent and 18 per cent respectively, as compared to the previous week. All regions reported decreasing trends in the number of new weekly cases and deaths. As of April 10, over 496 million confirmed cases and over 6 million deaths have been reported globally. ""These trends should be interpreted with caution as several countries are progressively changing their COVID-19 testing strategies, resulting in lower overall numbers of tests performed and consequently lower numbers of cases detected,"" it said. Over 11 billion vaccine doses have been distributed globally. WHO however noted that substantial inequities remain, with only 11 per cent of those in low-income countries (LICs) having completed the primary series; and major differences among regions, with vaccination coverage ranging from 82 per cent in the Western Pacific Region to 13 per cent in the African Region. ""There is particular concern about reaching the most vulnerable populations who remain unvaccinated, particularly those of older age and those with comorbidities,"" it said, adding that globally, an estimated 35 per cent of those aged 60 years and over are awaiting completion of the primary vaccination series.

The guidelines will be applicable for academic programmes other than Ph.D. In a letter to the Vice–Chancellors and principals of colleges and higher education institutes, Secretary, UGC, Rajnish Jain said the move was in line with the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020, ""which emphasises on the need to facilitate multiple pathways to learning involving both formal and non–formal education"". Explaining the rationale for the UGC's decision he wrote, ""With the rapid increase in demand for higher education and limited availability of seats in regular stream, several higher education institutes have started a number of programmes in Open and Distance Learning (ODL) to meet the aspirations of students. It has also led to the emergence of online education programmes."" The move has evoked mixed response. ""This decision will increase the load on universities. It doesn't increase the number of students enrolling in universities because the same student will study two courses. So, the gross enrolment ratio [GER] in higher education doesn't go up. The move will also lead to a demand for more teachers when thousands of vacancies for current needs haven't been filled. We are already stretched,"" said a former UGC Chairman who didn't want to be identified. The GER for higher education is at 27.1% according to the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) 2019-20. The NEP has set the target of raising this to 50% by 2035. Former Delhi University (DU) Vice–Chancellor Dinesh Singh welcomed the move, which the DU had already implemented during his tenure. ""Admission to one course doesn't preclude your capability to pursue another course. If a student is not capable, then they will not succeed. But if they are capable, let them take it. I think this decision was long overdue. Before my time at DU, students pursuing a second course on the sly would be penalised. Why penalise a student who is only looking to enhance his or her skills. This is why we decided to allow students to pursue more than one course.""

A surge in domestic cotton prices due to lower-than-anticipated crop yields had put pressure on the textile sector's export competitiveness vis-a-vis rivals like Vietnam and Bangladesh who don't levy any import duty on cotton.
 The government has exempted all cotton imports from customs duties from April 14 to September 30, 2022, with a view to help the textiles industry cope with raw material shortages. The move will also aid exports and provide relief to consumers, the Finance Ministry said. A surge in domestic cotton prices due to lower-than-anticipated crop yields had put pressure on the textile sector's export competitiveness vis-a-vis rivals like Vietnam and Bangladesh who don't levy any import duty on cotton. Cotton imports are taxed at about 11%, including cess and surcharges, in India. Higher cotton prices were also reflected in clothing and footwear inflation faced by domestic consumers, which surged to 9.4% in March, when retail inflation hit a 17-month high.","The government has exempted all cotton imports from customs duties from April 14 to September 30, 2022, with a view to help the textiles industry cope with raw material shortages .

117," Chennai Super Kings, playing its 200th IPL match, finally managed to get its first win of the season as it registered a 23-run victory over Royal Challengers Bangalore at the D.Y. Patil Stadium here on Tuesday. After being asked to bat first, the night belonged to Shivam Dube (95 n.o., 46b, 5x4, 8x6) and Robin Uthappa (88, 50b, 4x4, 9x6), who lit up the sky with some clean hitting to power the defending champion to a massive total of 216 for four, the highest of this edition.  The duo put on a superb batting exhibition, plundering 17 sixes between them and adding 165 for the third wicket off just 74 balls. Super Kings scored a whopping 156 in the final 10 overs. Later, Sri Lankan spinner Maheesh Theekshana spun the game towards the Men in Yellow with a brilliant four-wicket haul (4/33). Chasing a huge total, Royal Challengers started poorly as Theekshana accounted for openers Faf du Plessis and Anuj Rawat, while Mukesh Choudhary had Virat Kohli caught at deep square-leg.  Ravindra Jadeja then castled the dangerous Glenn Maxwell with a quicker delivery to put his side in the driving seat.  RCB stayed in the game when Suyash Prabhudessai and Shahbaz Ahmed combined for 60 runs for the fifth wicket off just 33 balls but Theekshana struck once again, removing both the batters. For a while, Dinesh Karthik, with a quickfire 34 off just 14 balls, looked like he was about to steal CSK's thunder, but was left to do a lot without support at the other end.  Earlier, the RCB bowlers Mohammed Siraj and Josh Hazlewood hit some good lengths and strangled CSK's batters, giving away just 35 in the PowerPlay. While Uthappa started slowly, Dube gave the innings the boost, going after spinners Maxwell, Shahbaz and Wanindu Hasaranga and clearing the fence with ease.  Uthappa then joined the party by hitting Maxwell for three sixes over midwicket — a pull and two slog-sweeps — in the 13th over. He was unstoppable as he launched into pacer Akash Deep, hitting him for a four and a six to reach his half-century.  Dube struck two sixes off Hazlewood in the final over as CSK finished with a flourish. RCB clearly missed the services of death-bowling specialist Harshal Patel and saw its three-game winning streak snapped.

119,"Host India has been seeded seventh and finds itself in the same group as top seed Australia, Pakistan and Indonesia, in the Asia-Oceania Junior Davis Cup under-16 boys' tennis to be played at the DLTA Complex from Monday. India, which strengthened itself with the last minute inclusion of Bushan Haobam, ranked 259 in the world under-18 list, opens its campaign against Pakistan on Monday. With 166th ranked Rushil Khosla and Debasis Sahoo as other members, India will try to win one of the three spots from the zone for the World Group. Quite understandably, Vansh Nandal — who was originally named in the team — was heart broken to hear his exclusion on Saturday night. It was at a preparatory camp that Bushan won all his 'trial' matches, but he does not play the under-16 circuit at all. ""Our idea is to field the best team,"" said national coach Zeeshan Ali, who had supervised the preparatory camp for the squad. When it was pointed out that the girls' team last week did not undergo any such trial after the team selection, Zeeshan stressed that the three best girls were already part of the team. Sajid Lodi, the captain, expressed confidence that the team would play its best in its attempt to progress further from the zone. India's first target would be to qualify for the knock-out stage from the group. The top two teams from each of the four groups will make the quarterfinals. Like in the girls' event, the Junior Billie Jean King Cup, it will only be three teams that will qualify for the World Group stage from the Asia-Oceania zone.

120,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Joseph Biden will hold a virtual meeting prior to the ""2+2"" Foreign and Defence ministerial meeting in Washington on Monday, to discuss bilateral relations and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and the U.S. White House announced on Sunday. However, while the White House said President Biden would speak about ""the consequences of Russia's brutal war against Ukraine"","" the MEA didn't refer directly to discussions about the conflict, where the U.S. and India have differences in their positions. ""The two leaders will review ongoing bilateral cooperation and exchange views on recent developments in south Asia, the Indo-Pacific region and global issues of mutual interest,"" the MEA statement said. Dramatic developments have been seen in south Asia, both in Pakistan, where Prime Minister Imran Khan's government was ousted over the weekend, and Sri Lanka, where massive protests over the economy are challenging the Rajapaksa government. The White House listed amongst subjects for discussion cooperation on ending the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, global economy, and ""upholding a free, open, rules-based international order to bolster security, democracy, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific"", as well as developing the ""Indo-Pacific Economic Framework"" on infrastructure expected to be announced during the 2+2 meeting.  ""President Biden will continue our close consultations on the consequences of Russia's brutal war against Ukraine and mitigating its destabilising impact on global food supply and commodity markets,"" the White House statement added. Ahead of the 2+2 ministerial meeting with U.. S. counterparts Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Defence Secretary Gen. (retired) Lloyd Austin, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh arrived in Washington on Sunday.  The Modi-Biden summit via videoconference, which was not announced earlier, follows a number of visits by senior U.S. officials to Delhi to discuss India's position on the Russian war in Ukraine, and signs of a strain in ties over the issue. While Mr. Biden referred to India as ""somewhat shaky"" amongst Quad countries, Deputy National Security Adviser Daleep Singh had spoken of ""consequences"" for countries that attempt to circumvent U.S. sanctions against Russia through alternative payment mechanisms, like the Rupee-Rouble system Delhi and Moscow are in talks about.  Subsequently, other officials have sought to downplay the differences between the two countries, indicating that Mr. Singh's words were not a ""warning"" to India., and India remains one of the U.S.'s ""most important partnerships"". Apart from joining U.S. and EU sanctions, Washington has been asking India not to increase its intake of Russian oil being offered at a discount, and to reconsider its position at the UN, where India has abstained on at least a dozen votes on the Ukraine conflict, including any statement critical of Russia's actions. In a Parliament debate last week, Mr. Jaishankar said India stood ""on the side of peace"" and for ""diplomacy and dialogue"".  At a U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee during a congressional hearing, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said the administration ""would prefer that India move away from their long-term history of non-alignment, G77 partnership with Russia.""","Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Joseph Biden will hold a virtual meeting prior to the ""2+2"" Foreign and Defence ministerial meeting in Washington on Monday .

Ms. Irani then reciprocated to a passenger who wished her 'happy Bihu'. But Ms. D'Souza said there cannot be Bihu without gas and stoves. When the Minister told the Congress leader not to lie (about non-availability of gas), the latter insisted on knowing why the price of gas was so high.

122," India has 103 active or defunct spacecraft and 114 objects categorised as 'space debris' in orbit and it has embarked on research to reduce such fragments from outer space.  ""Presently, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has taken up research activities to study the feasibility and technologies required to undertake active debris removal (ADR),"" Minister of State in PMO Jitendra Singh told parliament. According to Orbital Debris Quarterly News issued in March by NASA, India had 103 spacecraft, including active and defunct satellites, and 114 space debris objects, including spent rocket bodies orbiting the earth. So, the country has a total of 217 space objects orbiting the earth. Mr. Singh said Active Debris Removal (ADR) was one of the active methods suggested by the Space Debris Research Community to contain the growth of space debris objects.  ""ADR is a very complex technology and involves policy and legal issues. Technology demonstration studies have been taken up by many countries, including India. Developmental studies for finalising necessary technologies are initiated to demonstrate ADR,"" he said. A top ISRO official had told a technology conclave last year that the space agency was working on futuristic technologies such as self-eating rockets and vanishing satellites as part of measures to reduce space debris. According to the Orbital Debris Quarterly News, the U.S. has 4,144 spacecraft (active and defunct), and 5,126 objects that can be categorised as space debris in the earth's orbit. China has 517 spacecraft, active and defunct, and 3,854 objects, including spent rocket bodies, orbiting the earth. Mr. Singh said ISRO has also set up the Directorate Space Situational Awareness and Management at its headquarters to deal with issues related to space debris. A dedicated Space Situational Awareness Control Centre is set up in Bengaluru to coordinate all space debris related activities within ISRO and to safeguard Indian operational space assets from collision threats, he said.

126," SpaceX launched three rich businessmen and their astronaut escort to the International Space Station on Friday for more than a week's stay, as NASA joins Russia in hosting guests at the world's most expensive tourist destination. It's SpaceX's first private charter flight to the orbiting lab after two years of carrying astronauts there for NASA. Arriving at the space station Saturday will be an American, Canadian and Israeli who run investment, real estate and other companies. They're paying $55 million apiece for the rocket ride and accommodations, all meals included. Russia has been hosting tourists at the space station — and before that the Mir station — for decades. Just last fall, a Russian movie crew flew up, followed by a Japanese fashion tycoon and his assistant. NASA is finally getting into the act, after years of opposing space station visitors. ""It was a hell of a ride,"" said former NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria, the chaperone, on reaching orbit. The visitors' tickets include access to all but the Russian portion of the space station — they'll need permission from the three cosmonauts on board. Three Americans and a German also live up there. Lopez-Alegria plans to avoid talking about politics and the war in Ukraine while he's at the space station. ""I honestly think that it won't be awkward. I mean maybe a tiny bit,"" he said. He expects the ""spirit of collaboration will shine through."" The private Axiom Space company arranged the visit with NASA for its three paying customers: Larry Connor of Dayton, Ohio, who runs the Connor Group; Mark Pathy, founder and CEO of Montreal's Mavrik Corp.; and Israel's Eytan Stibbe, a former fighter pilot and founding partner of Vital Capital. Before the launch, their enthusiasm was obvious: Stibbe did a little dance when he arrived at the rocket at Kennedy Space Center. SpaceX and NASA have been upfront with them about the risks of spaceflight, said Lopez-Alegria, who spent seven months at the space station 15 years ago.  ""There's no fuzz, I think, on what the dangers are or what the bad days could look like,"" Lopez-Alegria told The Associated Press before the flight. Each visitor has a full slate of experiments to conduct during their nine to 10 days there, one reason they don't like to be called space tourists. ""They're not up there to paste their nose on the window,"" said Axiom's co-founder and president, Michael Suffredini, a former NASA space station program manager. The three businessmen are the latest to take advantage of the opening of space to those with deep pockets. Jeff Bezos' rocket company Blue Origin is taking customers on 10-minute rides to the edge of space, while Virgin Galactic expects to start flying customers on its rocket ship later this year. Friday's flight is the second private charter for Elon Musk's SpaceX, which took a billionaire and his guests on a three-day orbit ride last year. Axiom is targeting next year for its second private flight to the space station. More customer trips will follow, with Axiom adding its own rooms to the orbiting complex beginning in 2024. After about five years, the company plans to detach its compartments to form a self-sustaining station — one of several commercial outposts intended to replace the space station once it's retired and NASA shifts to the moon. At an adjacent pad during Friday's launch: NASA's new moon rocket, which is awaiting completion of a dress rehearsal for a summertime test flight. As a gift for their seven station hosts, the four visitors are taking up paella and other Spanish cuisine prepared by celebrity chef José Andrés. The rest of their time at the station, NASA's freeze-dried chow will have to do. The automated SpaceX capsule is due back with the four on April 19. Connor is honoring Ohio's air and space legacy, taking up a fabric swatch from the Wright brothers' 1903 Kitty Hawk flyer and gold foil from the Apollo 11 command module from the Neil Armstrong Air and Space Museum in Wapakoneta. Only the second Israeli in space, Stibbe will continue a thunderstorm experiment begun by the first — Ilan Ramon, who died aboard shuttle Columbia in 2003. They were in the same fighter pilot squadron. Stibbe is carrying copies of recovered pages of Ramon's space diary, as well as a song composed by Ramon's musician son and a painting of pages falling from the sky by his daughter. ""To be a part of this unique crew is a proof for me that there's no dream beyond reach,"" he said. ",SpaceX launches three rich businessmen and their astronaut escort to the International Space Station . It's SpaceX's first private charter flight to the orbiting lab after two years of carrying astronauts there for NASA . The visitors' tickets include access to all but the Russian portion of the space station - they'll need permission from three cosmonauts on board .,"SpaceX in its first private charter flight launched three rich businessmen and their astronaut escort to the International Space Station for more than a week's stay.

The private Axiom Space company arranged the visit with NASA for each visitor who will have a full slate of experiments to conduct during their nine to 10 days there."
127," Top Indian shuttlers P V Sindhu and Kidambi Srikanth progressed to the semifinals of the Korea Open Super 500 badminton tournament with contrasting wins here on Friday.  Third seed Sindhu, a two-time Olympic medallist, notched up her 17th win over familiar foe Thailand's Busanan Ongbamrungphan 21-10 21-16 in the women's singles quarterfinals.  She will next face second seeded Korean An Seyoung, a opponent who has beaten her twice last year.  In a battle between two former world number ones, it was World Championships silver medallist Srikanth, who rode on his power and precision to outwit local hope Son Wan Ho 21-12 18-21 21-12 in a men's singles quarterfinal match that lasted just over an hour.  Srikanth had a 4-7 record against the Korean, having lost to him on last three occasions.  However, the Indian played better badminton on Friday to come up trumps against an opponent, who is coming back to international badminton after a two-year hiatus.  The Indian, seeded fifth, will next face third seed Jonatan Christie of Indonesia, who had claimed the Swiss Open last month.  Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty failed to make it to the semifinal after going down fighting 20-22 21-18 20-22 to Korean pairing of Kang Minhyuk and Seo Seungjae.  In women's singles, Sindhu had no issues in disposing off Busanan, whom she had beaten at Swiss Open final last month. The Thai lead 5-2 in the opening game but after that it was a Sindhu show as she kept the match under her tight grip.  Leading 11-7, Sindhu produced an eight-point burst to pull away from the Thai and grab the lead in the match.  Things were similar after the change of sides as Sindhu held a 8-2 lead and kept moving ahead as the Thai crumbled.  In men's singles, Srikanth showed better control as he dominated the short rallies to move to a comfortable 11-6 lead at the first interval and though Son Wan Ho made it 12-14, the Indian soon changed gears to walk away with the first game.  The Korean came back strongly in the second game, opening up a 10-7 lead but Srikanth moved ahead to 13-11. An alert Son Wan Ho didn't let the game slip away and soon charged ahead to take it to the decider.  Srikanth made a rollicking 4-0 start in the decider but unforced errors allowed the Korean to make it 4-6. The Indian changed the pace with some quick attacking returns and his precision earned him returns. Srikanth managed a 11-7 lead at the interval.  A barrage of attacking shots kept Srikanth in the hunt as he extended his lead to 16-10. A precision return eventually got him to eight match points and he sealed it when Son Won Ho hit the net.

129,"In an unprecedented turn of events, at least 15 schools in the city and on the outskirts, many of which are top international schools, received a common bomb threat through a blast of emails on Friday morning. The threats, which the police later declared as a hoax, triggered panic among parents, students, and school managements keeping police on their toes.  At first, the Bengaluru city police received panic calls from a couple of schools. But as more school managements checked their emails later in the day, the numbers kept rising. Police teams were moving from one part of the city to another while dog squads and bomb detection squads were pressed into action. Manila Carvalho, principal of Delhi Public School, Bengaluru East, said that a flood of 140 mails from two email addresses reached the inbox around 11 a.m. They were sent to the email address listed on the school website. All the emails had the same text claiming that a powerful bomb had been placed in the school. The sender instructed school authorities to call the police to save lives. All the 15 schools which reported the emails by the end of Friday reported a similar trend: a large number of emails with the same text but from multiple email ids. Fortunately, the threat was a hoax. All schools were searched and declared safe by the end of the day.  All school premises that received the threat emails were evacuated and search operations were conducted.  School managements let off classes for the day and asked parents to collect their children home, without disclosing the exact reason to avoid panic. Even schools that did not receive the threat emails sent students back home.  Initially, schools that reported receiving the threat mails were in eastern and southeastern parts of the city. However, as the day progressed several schools in other parts of the city and on the outskirts also reported getting similar mails. ""We cannot rule out the possibility of more schools receiving emails. Many school managements may not be checking all the email ids listed on their websites constantly,"" said a senior police officer. Bengaluru City Police Commissioner Kamal Pant said four teams well versed with cyber investigations had been formed to track down the person or group of people behind the email. He expressed confidence that they would be caught soon. ""As the emails were reported, we knew they were a hoax, but left nothing to chance. We painstakingly cleared each premises as safe after a thorough search,"" he said.  Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai and Primary and Secondary Education Minister B. C. Nagesh appealed to parents not to nurse any anxiety over security at schools and all necessary precautionary measures were being taken.   A. Subramanyeswara Rao, Additional Commissioner of Police (Bengaluru East), said all the emails had come from gmail ids and the city police were in touch with Google and service providers to track down the IP address of the sender. ""We are confident of tracking the miscreant down shortly,"" he said.  Another senior officer involved in cyber crime investigations said that the very fact that the threat emails had been sent from gmail ids, which are easily traceable shows that the sender was a ""novice"" and may not be ""technologically sound"". The threat emails had been sent to email ids listed on the respective school websites, which shows it to be an ""amateur desktop job"".  ","At least 15 schools in the city and on the outskirts of Bengaluru received a common bomb threat through a blast of emails on Friday morning .

President Rajapaksa has declared a public Emergency on April 1 amid a spate of protests over the worst economic crisis in the country. The Emergency was imposed because of the mass scale protests planned for April 3 against the current economic hardships faced by the people. Later, the government imposed an island-wide curfew. Protests continued despite curfew and the state of emergency with senior ruling party figures having their homes surrounded by angry protesters who urged the government for solutions to the economic crisis. Several people were injured and vehicles were set on fire as the agitation turned violent. Police fired tear gas and water cannons at the protesters after they pulled down a steel barricade placed near the president's residence. Following the incident, several people were arrested and a curfew was briefly imposed in most parts of Colombo city. A foreign exchange crunch in Sri Lanka has led to a shortage of essential goods such as fuel and cooking gas. Power cuts that last up to 13 hours a day.

135,"Days after gruesome images of murdered civilians in the Bucha suburb of Kyiv surfaced, the White House announced that it would impose further sanctions on Russian entities and individuals, including a ban on American investments in Russia and sanctions on the families of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The latest round of punitive measures would be applied in concert with the EU and Group of Seven (G7) countries, the Biden administration announced. The measures against Russia would include ""full blocking sanctions"" on Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, and its largest private sector bank, Alfa Bank. No 'U.S. Person' (i.e., a resident entity or citizen) is permitted to transact with these banks and all their U.S. assets will be frozen.  President Joe Biden will also sign an executive order banning new investments in Russia by U.S. persons and the U.S. Treasury Department is expected to announce a ban on transactions by U.S. persons with a list of major Russian state-owned enterprises on Thursday. There will be a carve-out for energy sector enterprises. Europe is still heavily dependent on Russian energy imports.  Also announced on Wednesday were full blocking sanctions on the adult children of Mr. Putin and Mr. Lavrov's wife and daughters as well as Russian Security Council members — former President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and former Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. The White House also announced that carve-outs and exemptions would apply for humanitarian activities.  India is not directly impacted by this new set of sanctions as they are specific to the U.S., the EU and G7.

This week, U.S. officials have been questioned on India's participation in the U.S. sanctions regime and the impact of these sanctions, if India and China continue trade with Russia. Responding to The Hindu on Wednesday's briefing call, the senior administration official said: ""India is our friend, India's our partner and we share interests and we share core principles that are at stake in this conflict and we've had extensive discussions about ways to further our cooperation on global food security, on global energy supplies, and certainly in terms of recognising that Putin's brutality affects all of us and the geopolitical implications of Russia's actions do have ripple effects."" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, on Tuesday, had said the EU and G7 were joining the U.S. and this accounted for ""about 50%"" of the world economy, creating significant impact, while responding to a question on the effectiveness of this latest round of sanctions, given that some large economies like India, China and Brazil were not participating.  The U.S.'s ""expectation"" was that other countries would not only abide by the sanctions but also be a ""constructive part"" in holding Moscow accountable, Ms. Psaki said.

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar speaks in the Lok Sabha on April 6, 2022. Photo: SANSAD TV via PTI
 India will be ""glad"" to help in bringing about a resolution to the crisis in Ukraine, External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar said on Wednesday. Speaking in the Lok Sabha during a discussion under Rule 193 regarding the crisis in Ukraine and its implications, Dr. Jaishankar said that Russia is ""a very important partner"" but also held that India is against the conflict. He acknowledged the support provided by Russia, Ukraine and even Indian nationals based in Eastern Europe during Operation Ganga to evacuate Indian students from Ukraine.   ""In terms of diplomacy, India continues to press forcefully for an immediate cessation of hostilities and an end to violence. We encourage talks between Ukraine and Russia, including at the level of their Presidents. The Prime Minister has spoken to them both in this regard. This was precisely the message that was conveyed to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov when he was in Delhi. If India can be of any assistance in this matter, we will be glad to contribute,"" Dr. Jaishankar said, reiterating India's commitment to supply humanitarian goods to Ukraine. The EAM stated that the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, Yulia Svyrydenko, had requested him over a telephone call for more medical supplies to deal with the crisis. The Minister pointed to the non-military fallout of the crisis, which has affected a wide spectrum of economic activities like the energy and fertilisers sectors, and said the government is trying to ensure food security for common people in the country as well as in countries abroad. As part of the government's response to the crisis, he assured, India will step forward to meet ""global demands for food, grains and other materials"".   ""Our effort today is to stabilise economic transactions between India and Russia because this is very important for us. Russia is a very important partner in a variety of areas,"" Dr. Jaishankar said, indirectly referring to the crucial role that Russia plays in India's defence sector. Russia continues to remain the largest arms supplier to India despite strong competition from France, Israel, the United States and other western countries. The specific remarks on economic ties with Russia came after Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury sought an explanation on how India would conduct business with Russia as that country was hit by western sanctions.   ""At the moment, there is an inter-Ministerial group, which is led by the Finance Ministry, which is seeing how the payments issue can be best addressed. There are experiences from the past which are relevant in this regard,"" Dr. Jaishankar said, indicating at the pivotal role the Finance Ministry will pay in ensuring a smooth channel for transactions with Russia.   Editorial | In the middle: On India's role in Russia-Ukraine crisis Dr. Jaishankar conveyed India's strong opposition to the ongoing conflict. ""We believe no solution can be arrived at by shedding blood and at the cost of innocent lives. In this day and age, dialogue and diplomacy are the right answers to any dispute and this should be borne in mind. If India has chosen a side — it is the side of peace and it is for an immediate end to violence. This is our principled stand and it has consistently guided our position in international forums and debates, including in the United Nations.""  The Minister said that the conflict in Ukraine, which was invaded by Russia on February 24, posed a unique challenge in evacuating Indian students trapped in Kharkiv, Sumy and Kyiv, among other locations. ""No other country has carried out a similar operation. Other countries are inspired by our evacuation. I met the Foreign Minister of a country recently who said that they flew out two aircraft from Ukraine with their citizens, and he was surprised that we flew out 90 evacuation flights,"" Dr. Jaishankar said. He also said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had to intervene to ensure students could be evacuated safely from Kharkiv, and that he had to dial both Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Ukrainian leadership to create a conducive environment for evacuation.","External Affairs Minister S.

137,"As differences with the United States, the E.U. and other allied partners grow over India's position on Russia and Ukraine, the government is planning to reach out with a number of high–level diplomatic meetings planned in the next few months, sources said. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh will travel to Washington over the weekend for ""2+2"" ministerial talks with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Defence Secretary Gen. (Retd.) Lloyd Austin and other meetings on April 11–13 and will travel later this month to Tokyo for another ""2+2"".  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to visit India on April 21–22 while Prime Minister Narendra Modi is himself expected to travel to Germany for bilateral meetings and Denmark to attend the Nordic Summit in the first week of May, and to Tokyo for the Quad summit with leaders of Australia, Japan and the U.S. in June. The sources stressed that each of these visits has been planned for some time and could not take place earlier due to successive waves of the pandemic. However, the ongoing war in Ukraine and discussions on how to stop the Russian military operations there will be at the top of the agenda for all the foreign dignitaries engaging with India. While the programme is still being finalised, officials said they are discussing a possible summit in Gujarat for Mr. Johnson and Mr. Modi on April 21. The two leaders are expected to sign a number of agreements with the officials putting a breakthrough on the India-UK Free Trade Agreement talks as ""major priority"", as well as discussions on increasing cooperation in the Indo–Pacific. Mr. Johnson will inaugurate a construction equipment factory set up by British company JCB, which is owned by Brexit–favouring businessman and leading donor for Britain's ruling Conservative party, Lord Anthony Bamford. However, Mr. Johnson, who has been at the forefront of economic strictures and actions against Russia in the past few weeks, is definitely expected to discuss India's position on Ukraine, and the Modi government's decision to buy more Russian oil at discounted prices and set up a rupee–rouble payment mechanism to circumvent sanctions, something British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss also raised during her visit to Delhi last week. Mr. Johnson had to cancel his visit twice in the past two years due to the pandemic. PM Modi is expected to travel to Germany on May 1–2 to hold the bi–annual Inter–Governmental meeting, his first with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has been leading the European Union's (E.U.) actions with Russia and talks over the Ukraine crisis. In Delhi last week for consultations ahead of the meeting, German National Security Advisor (NSA) Jen Plotner had warned against any country 'backfilling' sanctions against Russia adding that ""no friendly country"" should take ""economic advantage of the war"" by circumventing the economic sanctions placed by the E.U. The conversations in Copenhagen, where Mr. Modi is expected to be on May 3–4, are expected to be similarly focused, as the leaders of the Nordic countries — Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden — gather for the summit last held in Stockholm in 2018. A plan to hold the summit in Denmark in June last year had to be cancelled due to the outbreak of the Covid-Delta variant in India, though Danish PM Mette Frederiksen visited India in October 2021.  The meetings follow a series of visits by a number of diplomats and Ministers from countries that are part of the sanctions regime urging India to shift its position on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, during a trip to Delhi after those visits, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made it clear that India–Russia ties remained on track, and both sides would seek ways to 'bypass' what he called illegal sanctions imposed by the U.S., E.U. and partners and allies.","External Affairs Minister S.

138,"Pakistan President Arif Alvi on Wednesday asked the Election Commission to fix a date for a new national ballot, as the Supreme Court adjourned hearing into the legality of political manoeuvres that led to Parliament being dissolved. The court — which will sit for a fourth day on Thursday — must rule if the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly violated the Constitution by refusing to allow a no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Imran Khan at the weekend. Had the vote taken place, Mr. Khan was certain to have been booted from office, but the move allowed him to get the loyalist President to dissolve Parliament and order an election. The Opposition has cried foul and is refusing to cooperate with forming an interim government to oversee any ballot, but on Wednesday Mr. Alvi upped the ante. A statement from his office said the Election Commission had been told to propose a date ""to carry out the mandate of the Constitution"". While the Opposition applied its resources to the court, Mr. Khan effectively hit the campaign trail — telling party workers in Lahore late Tuesday that he would be more careful in picking candidates to stand for his Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. It is unclear when or how the court will rule on the issue — or if Mr. Khan would even accept its decision — but there is a precedent. In 1988, Muhammad Khan Junejo appealed to the court after the Assembly was dissolved by then President General Zia-ul-Haq, who had taken power in a military coup years earlier. It agreed his government had been dissolved unconstitutionally, but ruled that since elections had been announced anyway it was best to move on.",Supreme Court adjourns hearing into legality of political manoeuvres that led to Parliament being dissolved .

139,"Telangana Minister and TRS working president K. T. Rama Rao on Wednesday said the policies of BJP government at the Centre were behind the rising fuel prices in the country and it was not correct to blame the States for the same.  ""On the one hand the BJP government at the Centre is constantly raising prices... on the other trying to push the blame on State governments. This is blatant lying and totally unacceptable,"" he said in an open letter.  Noting that he was writing the letter to turn the spotlight on the Centre's policies that were behind the soaring fuel prices, Mr.Rao, who is Minister for Industries, IT and Municipal Administration, contended that the reasons cited by the Modi government for not controlling prices were lies.  ""BJP leaders are simply narrating stories, such as the problems in the international crude oil supply, the rise in crude oil prices and the Russia-Ukraine war. But all this is not true,"" he said. The rising fuel prices were due to the ""inefficient policies adopted by the BJP and its failure in managing the country's economy... the BJP leaders at the Centre are lacking wealth-creating intellect. They are of the wrong impression that raising taxes exponentially with the power at hand is good governance,"" Mr. Rao said.  He said only the Basic excise duty, which relatively is a small component of the levy, is shared with the States by the Centre. At current price, the basic excise duty on petrol is only Rs.1.40 a litre. Of this, 41% or 57 paise, per litre, is distributed by the Centre to States. The share of Telangana is 2.133%. That is 0.01 paise per litre. The Centre, which is levying an excise duty of Rs 28 per litre, however, says it is giving a major share to the States. Also, the State get no share in the cess levied on petrol and diesel. ","Telangana Minister and TRS working president K. T.

140,"Mohamed Nazim, a chicken vendor based in south Delhi's INA Market, decided to keep his shutters down on Tuesday after finding out about the letter calling for the closure of meat shops written by South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) Mayor Mukesh Suryan. Speaking to  The Hindu, which visited the market on Wednesday, most vendors said that the news of the letter -- and a possible shutdown -- caused immense confusion in the market. Vendors reported dumping their day's stock, incurring losses.  ""We wanted to avoid trouble. Some media persons paid a visit to the market late in the evening on Monday. Through them, we heard that fines will be imposed and our licenses might be revoked, so we got scared and decided not to open,"" said a meat vendor who did not wish to be named. In the letter, Mr. Suryan asked the civic body's commissioner to shut all meat shops, under the SDMC's jurisdiction, as it affected the ""religious belief and sentiments"" of those who hold fasts during the nine-day period of the Navratri festival. However, senior civic officials, Amit Kumar, Director of SDMC's Press and Information, said no order has been implemented to shut meat shops.  ""In my 22 years of working here, never did I see the meat market being shut because of such developments. At least 70% of our customers are foreigners, and the rest are locals. All of them were confused and found it absurd that the meat shop owners in the market had to shut down because of the Mayor's letter. On the other hand, we suffered a loss of close to ₹2,00,000, while our stock went was wasted,"" said Mohammed Sajid, a worker at a meat vend.  Echoing a similar view was Sidharth, a fish vendor at the market for eight years, who said he suffered heavy losses.  ""The political purpose of what the letter aimed to create has been served. The media received the letter before we did, and we have not implemented any order to shut the shops. The INA market is under the jurisdiction of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC),"" said a senior civic official.  Simultaneously, restaurant owners based in the market also expressed discontent with some stating that they were unable to procure their stocks due to the disruption. ""It is a political situation and seemingly communal. It has affected our business. Over 80% of my customers come here to eat non-vegetarian dishes, which means a big chunk of my day's business went for a toss,"" said a restaurant owner.  However, Ramesh Bhutani, the president of INA Market Traders Association, underplayed the concerns expressed by the vendors and said that, on Tuesday, the market had reopened at close to 3 p.m., while agreeing that some media personnel had created confusion during their visit on Monday.  He added, ""The licenses for the meat shops are issued by the SDMC. We contacted other markets and their shops were open. The vendors did not suffer major losses, only a little loss was incurred. We are ready to comply with orders, whatever they may be. But we should be informed beforehand to help us avoid losses.""  However, the SDMC Mayor's letter is not a first; in February, the civic body's Education Committee chairperson Nitika Sharma (BJP), issued a letter to ensure that students do not wear religious attire in schools but laid strong emphasis against the wearing of hijab. Previously, Ms. Sharma, a councillor from Dwarka, said, ""We do not want such incidents (hijab controversy) to take place elsewhere. The letter has been sent to the Director of Education (SDMC) and will be enforced. If a small girl is covered and sent to school, won't that affect her confidence level and make her feel different? If they want to wear hijab and show their religion, then they should go to madrasas. We don't want the children to feel unequal, and this (instructions) will be implemented without a resolution."" SDMC's Director of Primary Education Pradeep Kumar, however, said the civic body has taken no decision to enforce these instructions in its schools. When reached out for a comment, V.K. Singh, Director of the civic body's veterinary department, said that he continues to remain unaware of the letter and declined to comment further.  ""Either the party [BJP] must have given him [Mayor] the directions, or someone else, but he cannot take such a decision on his own,"" said a source in the BJP. Leader of Opposition at the SDMC, Prem Chauhan (AAP), said that he was against the Mayor's call to shut meat shops. He said, ""people should live and let live"". He added, ""I do not consume meat, but I don't have a problem with those who do. This letter is a political gimmick to seek attention.""  When asked about the party's stand, AAP in charge of municipal corporations, Durgesh Pathak said, ""In neighbouring UP and Haryana there is no ban on the sale of meat and there is no point in doing it in Delhi alone. If all neighbouring states are doing it, only then there is any benefit in the move.""  He did not comment on whether the party supported the demand by the BJP to ban the sale of meat during Navaratri.","South Delhi Mayor Mukesh Suryan wrote a letter calling for closure of meat shops in south Delhi's INA Market .

141,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi chose his address to BJP workers and leaders on the party's foundation day to assert that dynastic parties were the ""biggest enemies"" of democracy and that the BJP, in marked contrast, stood for devotion to the country rather than a family.  This is the second time he has, in this Parliament session, hit out at dynastic politics in his speeches to partymen. A few weeks ago, right after the results for five Assembly polls were declared, he said the same in his address to the BJP parliamentary party.  ""Dynastic parties are dedicated to further family rule and have little regard for constitutional norms, and cover up corruption and misdeeds of each other even though they may be active in different States,"" he said. In a reference to geopolitical developments following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he pointed out that India was acting by keeping its national interest supreme when the world was divided in two opposing poles. Targeting political rivals, he observed that when these parties active nationally or in States come to power, members of some families dominate from local bodies to Parliament. Only the BJP has challenged them and made it an electoral issue. They did not allow the country's young talent to come up and betrayed them, he said, without naming any party. He noted that BJP governments had run welfare schemes without any discrimination and worked to take them to every beneficiary, while previous dispensations were driven by vote-bank politics in which some sections of society were made promises while larger sections ignored. The BJP succeeded in convincing people of the dangers of such an approach, he stressed. Discrimination and corruption were ""side effects"" of vote-bank politics, he remarked. The government machinery now worked to reach every intended beneficiary as part of its resolve for saturation coverage of welfare programmes. Any discrimination cannot stay in such a mechanism, he said, asserting these measures were the biggest instrument of social justice. For the BJP, he said, ""rajniti"" (politics) and ""rashtra niti"" (policies for country's welfare) cannot be separate. The ongoing programmes to mark the 75th anniversary of Independence and the ""rapidly changing"" global order that has presented the country with new opportunities made the ruling party's foundation day ""very important"", he claimed and cited the BJP's poll success in retaining power in four States as another key marker along with it becoming the first party in three decades to have 100 members in the Rajya Sabha. Mr. Modi asserted that India was working by keeping its national interest supreme. It was unflinching about its welfare. It was globally being seen as a country that spoke firmly about humanity. It now had convergence of policies, intentions, decisiveness and determination, he added.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi said dynastic parties were the ""biggest enemies"" of democracy .

142,"Creating rights with gusto through new welfare acts would become mere lip service unless their financial impact was kept in mind, the Supreme Court cautioned the Centre on Wednesday. The court's oral remark referred to how the government promised dedicated protection officers and shelter homes for women who suffered domestic abuse but has not delivered yet. Yet again, the government enacted the law on the right to education but did not have funds to build the sufficient number of schools or pay decent salaries to teachers working in the programme. As a result, a three-judge Bench led by Justice U.U. Lalit said, the court was flooded with litigation. ""Revenue officials double up as 'protection officers' under the Domestic Violence Act when the training for these protection officers is completely different... Look at the Right to Education law, where are the schools? You have appointed people as shiksha mitra and shiksha karmi and pay them ₹5,000. They come to court seeking parity in pay. When we ask the States, they say 'where is the money?' So, whenever you bring in an Act, keep the financial impact in mind... When any legislation is enacted, its financial impact has to be assessed... Otherwise, all this becomes only lip-service... You create a right and the courts are left in difficulty,"" Justice Lalit addressed the Centre, represented by Additional Solicitor-General Aishwarya Bhati. The court was hearing a writ petition filed by an NGO, 'We the Women of India', about the lack of protection officers and shelter homes' infrastructure in various States as promised under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence (DV) Act of 2005. Advocate Shobha Gupta, for the NGO, said shelter homes were an essential part of the Act. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat, who is also part of the Bench along with Justice P.S. Narasimha, said the Centre, as a nodal agency under the law, should conduct a statistical assessment of the number of protection officers and how many/the kind of infrastructure required for shelter homes in different States. The court said the number of protection officers would vary according to the size of each State and the number of domestic abuse cases. Justice Bhat said things would have been easier if the States had their own portal in which they could upload the statistics. In its previous order on February 25, the court had found that in many States revenue officers or even Indian Administrative Service (IAS) were designated as protection officers under the 2005 Act. ""This clearly was not the intent of the law-makers, since such revenue or administrative officials would be unable to devote time to discharge the fairly intense work required and expected of protection officers. In some States, the number of districts and their geographical dispersion is large but the number of officers actually provided are disproportionately small compared to the geographical dispersion and vastness of the State,"" the court had noted in the February 25 order. Subsequently, the court had asked the government to provide details, by April 6, of the nature of Central programmes/plans outlining assistance to support the efforts under the DV Act by various States, including the extent of funding, conditions of governing financial support and the control mechanisms in place. The court had wanted the Centre to collect State-wise relevant data of litigation under the DV Act with respect to the complaints made, number of courts and the relative number of protection officers; the conditions of service, training and creation of a regular cadre of protection officers; their career progression, etc. ""This court is of the opinion that these particulars are essential because the protection officers, like the magistrates who are tasked to the implementation of the enactment, have been conceived as the backbone to effectuate the law, enacted with laudable objectives, by Parliament,"" the court noted. However, on Wednesday, Ms. Bhati sought more time to compile the data and file an affidavit. ""The work is in progress... But we have to get information from the States... This information is not readily available with us,"" the central law officer said. 
The court gave the Centre two weeks to file a status report. It listed the case on April 26.

145," Volkswagen Passengers Car India is likely go in for another price hike on select few models by 3% from May following a rise in raw material cost coupled with increase in fuel prices, said a top official. ""We have been facing semiconductor chip shortage for the last one-and-a half years, which was already constraining the supply-line demand,"" said Ashish Gupta, brand director, Volkswagen Passenger Cars India. ""Now, coupled with an uptake in demand, it has been a tough time to balance our supply and that will continue for next six months at least.""  Asserting that the raw material prices had risen by 6-8% and the prices of steel and most precious metals were still at all- time high, he said this had put enormous pressure on input cost. The company will pass on the cost to customers during May. Mr. Gupta said that though there was some respite from semiconductor chip shortage in January and February, he foresaw shortage of chips along with some critical components in the coming months. This would lead to removal of certain infotainment features in premium cars. Some of the kits for assembly of components for premium cars comes from Europe. Given the situation in Europe, this has put pressure on production of premium cars. This will have cascading effect.

148,"South Africa raced to a 220-run victory in the first Test after Bangladesh's collapse to 53 all out on the morning of the final day on Monday. Bangladesh lasted only 19 overs in its second innings and South Africa needed only two bowlers to roll the tourists out. They were both spinners, with left-armer Keshav Maharaj collecting 7-32 and offspinner Simon Harmer 3-21. They both cashed in on spin-friendly conditions on a wearing pitch to take South Africa home. It was a surprisingly sudden end to the match after Bangladesh had hopes of possibly pulling off its first Test victory over South Africa by needing 274 runs in the final innings. But the tourists slumped to 11-3 at the close of play on Day 4 in Durban and the wickets continued to tumble dramatically on the morning of Day 5. No. 3 Najmul Hossain Shanto (26) and tailender Taskin Ahmed (14) were the only Bangladesh batters to reach double figures and South Africa needed less than an hour of play on Monday to take those remaining seven wickets and take a 1-0 lead in the two-Test series. Bangladesh's total was its second-lowest in Test cricket after the 43 it was bowled out for against West Indies in 2018. Its 53 was also the lowest test total ever at the Kingsmead ground in Durban. The huge winning margin belied a Test which was competitive for much of the time. It might even have tipped slightly in Bangladesh's favor at one point on the fourth day when South Africa went from 116-1 to 204 all out in its second innings to give the touring team a sight at that historic Test win over the Proteas. Bangladesh had already won its first one-day series in South Africa earlier in the tour. But its hopes in the first Test were ripped away by Maharaj and Harmer, with Maharaj's seven at his home ground taking him to 141 career Test wickets, now the most by a South African spinner since the country returned to international cricket after apartheid. The second test is in Port Elizabeth and starts on Thursday.",South Africa raced to a 220-run victory in the first Test in Durban .

Rana Ayyub
 The Delhi High Court Monday quashed the Look Out Circular (LOC) issued against journalist Rana Ayyub noting that it was ""devoid of merits"" and infringed upon her human right to travel abroad, and to exercise her freedom of speech and expression.  Justice Chandra Dhari Singh also permitted Ms. Ayyub to travel abroad with the condition that she will intimate her travel dates and detailed itinerary to the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is investigating her for alleged misappropriation of funds collected in the name of relief work. Ms. Ayyub was detained at the Mumbai Airport by the Bureau of Immigration on March 29, from where she was scheduled to travel to London to attend an event. The High Court observed that the LOC was issued in ""haste and despite the absence of any precondition necessitating such a measure"". It said, ""LOC is a coercive measure to make a person surrender"" and consequentially interferes with Ms. Ayyub's right to personal liberty and free movement. The ED, during the hearing, did not contradict the submission made by Ms. Ayyub, that she has appeared on each and every date before the investigating agency when summoned. ""Hence, there is no cogent reason for presuming that the petitioner [Ms. Ayyub] would not appear before the Investigation Agency and hence, no case is made out for issuing the impugned LOC,"" the High Court remarked. Justice Singh observed, ""a balance has to be struck qua the right of the investigation agency to investigate the instant matter as well as the fundamental right of the petitioner of movement and free speech"". The judge ordered Ms. Ayyub to deposit an FDR to the tune of ₹1 lakh before the ED at its Mumbai office. and told her to return to India on the date specified, April 11, 2022. Advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for Ms. Ayyub, submitted that her client is a globally renowned journalist and is being persecuted for speaking truth to power and being critical of the incumbent establishment. On March 29, Ms. Ayyub was stopped at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, Mumbai, before boarding a flight to London to attend an event about the global problem of cyber-attacks against women journalists on April 1 at London, as well as to deliver a keynote speech in Rome on the status of journalism in India on April 5. ED, however, said that Ms. Ayyub is involved in a ""very serious offence"" and had misappropriated funds collected in the name of relief work. It stated that Ms. Ayyub had submitted fake bills and thus the money raised for relief work was siphoned off. ED said it had attached her assets worth ₹1.77 crore in connection with alleged irregularities in the collection of charitable funds for COVID relief work. It apprehended that if she was allowed to leave the country she would not come back. The High Court, however, rejected the ED's contention and quashed the LOC.","Rana Ayyub was detained at the Mumbai Airport by the Bureau of Immigration on March 29 .

155," India and Nepal on Saturday discussed the Kalapani border dispute, said Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba in New Delhi. Addressing the media after holding bilateral talks, the visiting Prime Minister jointly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the first cross border rail link between India and Nepal. Nepal also became the 105th member country to sign on to the Framework Agreement of International Solar Alliance (ISA).  ""We discussed the boundary issue and I urged Modiji to resolve it through the establishment of a bilateral mechanism,"" said Mr Deuba. The visit of the Nepalese leader is the first since the Kalapani boundary issue erupted in November 2019 after the revised political map of India depicted the triangular area of Kalapani-Lipulek-Limpiyadhura within the territory of Uttarakhand. In a tit-for-tat move, Kathmandu responded by placing a revised political map of the country in the national insignia of Nepal. Both sides were expected to address the issue under an existing mechanism led by the Foreign Secretaries but that meeting is yet to be announced. Nepal had earlier written to New Delhi seeking the meeting of the Foreign Secretary-level mechanism to discuss the border dispute at Kalapani. India also urged Nepal to avoid ""politicisation"" of the boundary dispute. Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla briefing the media after the talks said, ""There was a general understanding that both sides needed to address this in a responsible manner through discussion and dialogue. In the spirit of our close and friendly relations, politicisation of such issues should be avoided."" India's position on avoiding politicisation of the Kalapani issue appears to be aimed at the upcoming election season in the Himalayan country when emotive issues like the border dispute are expected to be raised during political campaigns by both the opposition led by former PM K P Sharma Oli and some sections of the ruling coalition of Nepali Congress and CPN - Maoist Center. The two leaders inaugurated the broad gauge Jaynagar-Kurtha rail link that will establish rail connectivity to Janakpur in Nepal. India also launched the RuPay card facility in Nepal during the formal ceremony held at the Hyderabad House. ""This would open new vistas for cooperation in financial connectivity, and is expected to facilitate bilateral tourist flows as well as further strengthen people to people linkages between India and Nepal,"" declared an official statement that was issued at the end of official discussion here.  The two sides came out with a Joint Vision Statement on Power Sector cooperation between India and Nepal recognising ""unprecedented opportunities"". Prime Minister Modi and PM Deuba jointly inaugurated the 90 km long 132 KVDC Solu Corridor Transmission line and substation that were built through the Line of Credit extended by India.  Addressing the meeting, Mr Modi said, ""The close friendship between India and Nepal has no comparison anywhere in the world."" He welcomed the Nepalese leader's decision to visit Varanasi on Sunday where Mr Deuba is expected to visit the Vishwanath temple. Both the leaders welcomed the February 28 Nepal-India agreement to enable long term supply of fertilizers from India to Nepal, a key demand of Kathmandu to deal with the fertilizer crisis in the country. For the past few years, Nepal's agriculture sector has been suffering from a shortage of urea and chemical fertilizers. Under the G-2-G agreement, Kathmandu can import around 210,000 metric tonnes of chemical fertilizer from India annually.  India and Nepal have been working on building a tourism circuit that connects the pilgrimage sites located in the two countries. The Vishwanath temple of Varanasi is part of that vision which intends to connect devotees with the Pashupatinath temple of Kathmandu.  Mr Modi also referred to joint efforts to stop illegal activities and crime along the border between the two sides. India and Nepal have around 1850 km long open border and both sides are expected to undertake measures to strengthen the security situation along the border. Both sides also discussed security-related issues when National Security Adviser Ajit Doval called upon Prime Minister Deuba on Saturday morning.

156," India and Australia signed an Economic Co-operation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) on Saturday in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his counterpart in Canberra Scott Morrison, with an eye on doubling bilateral trade to $50 billion in five years and ease movement of people, goods and services across borders.   The agreement with Australia, which Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal expects would create 10 lakh additional jobs in the country over the next five years, was described as a 'watershed moment in bilateral ties' by Mr. Modi.  ""On the basis of this agreement, together, we will be able to increase the resilience of supply chains, and also contribute to the stability of the Indo-Pacific region,"" he said about the deal that will facilitate work visas for two to four years for Indian students in Australia on a 'reciprocal basis' and allow Indian chefs and yoga professionals to work Down Under.  The trade and economic partnership deal with Australia, which is in the midst of a protracted trade battle with China, is a significant milestone at a time when the developed world is looking to hedge its supply chain dependence. A government statement noted that this is also the first such pact signed by India with a developed country in a decade.   Mr. Morrison said the deal ""opens a big door into the world's fastest growing major economy for Australian farmers, manufacturers, producers and so many more"".  Indian exports to Australia have been growing at a rapid clip and the agreement, which may be expanded further after its implementation in the current form, will facilitate zero duty access ""on over 96% of Indian exports, including several labour-intensive industries,"" Mr. Goyal said.  India will, in turn, offer preferential access to Australia on over 70% of its tariff lines on goods imports, including 'lines of export interest to Australia which are primarily raw materials and intermediaries such as coal, mineral ores and wines, etc.', the Commerce Ministry said.  In a joint statement with Mr. Morrison, Australia's trade, tourism and industry minister Dan Trehan said: ""Tariffs will be eliminated on more than 85% of Australian goods exports to India (valued at more than $12.6 billion a year), rising to almost 91% (valued at $13.4 billion) over 10 years.""  Poll worries and safeguards Talks with Australia for a possible trade and economic partnership pact had begun about a decade ago, but were aborted after a previous regime in Canberra asked India to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership instead. After India refused to join the RCEP, negotiations were stalled. Fresh parleys between the two sides began last September after Mr. Trehan visited India.  Australia, which goes to polls this year, has agreed to amend its tax laws to resolve India's long-standing complaint that its firms providing technical services in the country are taxed on their offshore income. Both trade ministers said the electoral cycle will not impact the trade pact.  ""Elections will come and go. I think nations survive beyond elections… In fact, my own party came into government in 2014. And I can share with you we never went back on a single decision concluded and finalised by the previous government,"" said Mr. Goyal, stressing that both the countries' governments work for the benefit of the people in national interest and their decisions are 'permanent'.  With a rich repertoire of vineyards in Yarra Valley and beyond, Australia will now be able to export wine bottles of 750 ml, costing over $5 dollars, to India at a concessional import duty and the countries have agreed to set up a Joint Dialogue to work together on Wine-related trade issues. A working group will also be set up to resolve issues related to bilateral trade in whisky and other alcoholic beverages.   The Commerce Ministry said the agreement provides adequate safeguards to prevent circumvention and protect against a sudden surge in import of goods. It also said this is the first trade deal which includes a compulsory review mechanism after 15 years.  This is the second economic partnership pact signed within a week, following a similar deal with the United Arab Emirates last week. Mr. Goyal said more such deals are in the offing as India looks to accelerate its exports growth after crossing a record $400 billion in 2021-22.  ""We are in very active dialogue with the United Kingdom, Canada, and have agreed to work on an interim agreement with both that can be done faster, followed by a comprehensive arrangement,"" he said.   Talks with the European Union that began in July 2021 are also moving ahead with Commerce Secretary BVR Subrahmanyam expected to be in Brussels next week to firm up the timelines and scope of agreement.  ""We are also in dialogue with Israel and we have received interest from the Gulf Co-operation Council to bring together all the six nations into a Comprehensive Economic Partnership with us,"" the Minister noted.

Ms. Kotagal, who is the daughter of immigrants from India, is a partner at Cohen Milstein, a member of the firm's Civil Rights and Employment practice group, and co-chair of the firm's Hiring and Diversity Committee.  She is the co-author of the seminal legal template 'Inclusion Rider'. Ms. Kotagal is also a diversity, equity and inclusion expert, and represents disenfranchised people in employment and civil rights litigation involving issues related to Title VII, Equal Pay Act, Americans with Disabilities Act, Family and Medical Leave Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act, the White House said. Indian-American Impact, nation's leading civic Indian American and South Asian organisation, welcomed the nomination of Ms. Kotagal to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  ""Kotagal is an exceptionally talented litigator who has been a fierce advocate for employment equity and civil rights,"" said Neil Makhija, executive director of Indian American Impact.  ""She has broken barriers as one of the first South Asian women to become a law partner in the plaintiffs' bar and has been a leading voice in the national conversation on diversity, equity and inclusion.""  ""We are proud to give our emphatic support to her nomination and look forward to celebrating her confirmation,"" Mr. Makhija said. Mr. Singh, a Certified Public Accountant, is currently senior advisor to the Administrator at the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), assisting agency teams to deliver organisational efficiencies to better serve our communities' small businesses.  He has 25 years of private sector leadership experience with a deep understanding of finance, analytics and strategy.

158,"VATICAN CITY Pope Francis headed to the Mediterranean island nation of Malta on Saturday for a pandemic-delayed weekend visit, aiming to draw attention to Europe's migration challenge that has only become more stark with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Pope is likely to encourage Europe's embrace of Ukrainian refugees while also urging countries to extend the same welcome to migrants coming from Libya and elsewhere.  Rather than take the stairs up to the ITA aircraft, Pope Francis stood inside a wheelchair lift, a sign that his painful knees were bothering him. It was the first time he has used the elevator and was an indication that the inflammation has gotten worse. The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, said migration will top the agenda for Francis' trip and said Europe's reception of Ukrainian refugees was ""truly admirable.""  ""I hope that this tragic experience can also really help to grow, to increase sensitivity also towards the other migration, the one that comes from the south,"" he told Vatican Media. Although short, the two-day visit was already going to be challenging for the 85-year-old Pope Francis, who has had increasing trouble walking due to an inflamed ligament in his right knee. He has struggled in recent days to stand up from his chair and climb stairs, and his limping gait from sciatica has appeared more pronounced.  While he was able to use the elevator to board the plane, Pope Francis is due to board a catamaran Saturday afternoon for a sailing trip to the island of Gozo, and on Sunday plans to descend the steps into the Grotto of St. Paul in Rabat.  Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the elevator was decided upon in the past day to avoid subjecting the pontiff to unnecessary strain. He suggested a similar measure was expected in Valletta. Pope Francis had been due to visit Malta in May 2020, but postponed the visit after the coronavirus pandemic hit. The rescheduled trip comes as the Catholic Church in the overwhelmingly Catholic country is preparing for its first in-person Easter Week celebrations in two years. Maltese Archbishop Charles Scicluna, who is also a top Vatican official, asked for prayers for the visit, not least because of Pope Francis' catamaran trip Saturday.  ""That should be lovely if he has the right weather for it, but the last two weekends before the pope's trip have been an unmitigated disaster weather-wise,"" Scicluna told The Associated Press. ""So we pray for something we cannot organize: the weather.""",Pope Francis heads to Malta for a pandemic-delayed weekend visit .

The visit is going to be challenging for the 85-year-old Pope Francis, who has had increasing trouble walking due to an inflamed ligament in his right knee."
159,"Mali's army said on Friday that it had killed 203 combatants in an operation in the centre of Sahel state, an apparent uptick in violence in the conflict-torn country. The army said the March 23-31 military operation took place in Sahel's Moura area — which it termed a ""terrorist fiefdom"". Soldiers killed 203 militants, arrested 51 people and seized large quantities of weapons, according to the army's statement. The announcement comes as numerous social media reports in Mali this week alleged that dozens of people, including civilians, had been killed in Moura.  Reacting to the news on Saturday, the UN's peacekeeping mission in Mali, known as Minusma, stated that it was ""very concerned about the allegations of violence against civilians"". AFP was unable to verify the army's claimed death toll or the social media reports about civilian deaths. Poor access to Mali's conflict areas and a relative lack of independent information sources means that figures provided by either the government or armed groups are difficult to confirm. An impoverished nation of around 21 million people, Mali has struggled to contain a jihadist insurgency that emerged in 2012, before spreading to neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.  Vast swathes of the country are are home to myriad rebel groups and militias, and thousands of soldiers and civilians have been killed in the conflict. Mali's under-equipped army has also often been accused of committing abuses during the conflict. According to a report seen by AFP, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently warned the UN Security Council that Mali's counter-terrorism efforts had ""disastrous consequences for the civilian population"". In its statement on Friday, Mali's army said it was guided by human rights and international law, and called for ""restraint against defamatory speculations"".  The country has seen an apparent uptick in violence in recent weeks. The UN said on Friday that thousands of people fleeing fighting in Mali have arrived in Niger. A day earlier, the peacekeeping mission Minusma said that security had ""deteriorated considerably"" in the border area with Burkina Faso and Niger.

up even further and triggered chaos at the London Metal Exchange in early March. Prices of other metals used in cars, including aluminum, palladium and
lithium, have also soared recently. Tesla, the world's largest automaker, signed the multi-year supply deal with
Vale for nickel from Canada, Bloomberg reported. Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Vale declined to comment on the report, but said it had stated previously
that the company currently sells 5% of its production into the EV market and
plans to increase that to 30%-40%. Tesla has been less affected by supply chain issues arising out of the
COVID-19 pandemic, when compared with other automakers that have cut production as they face shortage of several components including chips and battery metals of EVs. CEO Elon Musk said earlier this month that the
electric car maker and his rocket company SpaceX are facing significantinflationary pressures in raw materials and logistics.","Tesla Inc has signed an undisclosed deal with Brazilian mining company Vale S.A. for nickel, Bloomberg News reports .

161,"The Union Government informed a UAPA tribunal that Islamist preacher Zakir Naik, ""despite leaving for Malaysia in 2016,"" continues to reach out to his followers promoting hatred and ill-will between different religious communities, forcible conversion of youth to Islam and make derogatory statements against the Hindu, Hindu Gods and other religions.  Indian agencies have been trying to get a red notice by Interpol against him for the past seven years.  In November 2021, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) extended the ban on Naik's NGO- the Islamic Research Foundation (IRF), by another five years. The IRF was first declared an unlawful association in 2016 under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) after a terror attack in Bangladesh.  The order upheld by the UAPA tribunal and published in the Gazette of India on March 30 said that ""the speeches of Dr. Zakir Naik, were objectionable as he has been extolling known terrorists, proclaiming that every Muslim should be a terrorist and promoting forcible conversion of the youth to Islam, justifying the suicide bombings, posting objectionable comments against Hindu, Hindu's God and other religions which are derogatory to other religions and further inspiring the Muslim youth and terrorists in India and abroad to commit terrorist acts.""  It further said, ""Furthermore, the unlawful activities of IRF, its members as well as its sympathizers were noticed in States of Gujarat, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra and Odisha"".  The IRF told the tribunal that it was a registered charitable public trust with pious and virtuous objects and that it had never indulged in any unlawful activity at any point of time. It stated that all allegations made by the Central government in the notification were either stale or vague and failed to demonstrate the registration of a case against Naik or for banning the IRF.  ""The fact that the Central Government is of the opinion that the foundation should be continued to be banned after an earlier ban of 5 years, it ought to have referred to new material and facts pertaining to the period between 2016-2021 which reflected the requirement to ban the foundation again. The notification does not disclose any activity which may attract the provisions of the UAPA, 1967 or Sections 153-A or 153-B of the Indian Penal Code,"" the IRF said.

162,"Union ministers Bhupender Yadav and R.K. Singh on Thursday parried questions from Opposition members in the Lok Sabha on how India planned to address emissions from its coal plants and whether it had a strategy in place to deal with climate refugees, saying the government had provisioned for these and was en-route to sourcing more of its energy from non-fossil fuel sources. As part of a discussion in the Lok Sabha on climate change, Dravida Munetra Kazhagam MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi and Saugata Roy of the Trinamool Congress wanted to know if the government was prepared to deal with the influx of 'climate refugees' or those who would be forced to move away from the coasts and their traditional habitations because of rising sea levels and soil erosion.  Mr. Roy also sought to know how the government proposed to deal with coal plants and the environmental pollution resulting from mining and burning of coal given India's commitment at the United Nations Conference of Parties (COP 26) to increase its share of renewable energy. Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Mr. Yadav, gave a detailed reply on several aspects of environmental pollution, the rationale governing India's position on climate change and how the country is balancing economic growth and its consequences to the environment. ""Western nations have a historical responsibility to address the greenhouse gas emissions they have emitted. We have a national adaptation fund and national disaster resilience infrastructure fund to take care of potential climate refugees,"" he said. Power Minister R.K.

164,"The government on Thursday opted to leave interest rates on small savings instruments like the Public Provident Fund unchanged for April to June 2022, maintaining the status quo for the eighth successive quarter.  The Reserve Bank of India had indicated the need to pare interest rates on these schemes between 0.09 and 1.18 percentage points in the coming quarter. However, the resurgence of inflation beyond 6% in the last two months and the upswing in oil prices may have weighed against taking an unpopular step, especially after the Employees' Provident Fund rate for 2021-22 was reduced from 8.5% to 8.1% earlier this month, the lowest in over 42 years.  The rates on various small savings schemes were last reduced in the range of 0.5 and 1.4 percentage points in April 2020, and an announcement of further cuts ranging from 0.4% to 1.1% on March 31 , 2022, was revoked by April 1.   The quarterly interest rate paid on one year term deposits remains 5.5%, Senior Citizen Savings' Scheme will continue to earn 7.4%, while the Sukanya Samriddhi Account Scheme's return is 7.6%. The PPF return will remain at 7.1%.    ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar said small savings rates may be increased in the latter half of the year following expected rate hikes by the central bank through August and October.

165,"The Indian auto component industry is expected to clock 8-10% growth in FY23, supported by the easing of supply-chain issues and commodity inflation in the second half of the year, according to rating agency Icra. For 2021-22, the revenue growth of the industry is pegged at 13-15%, driven by domestic OEM, replacement, export volumes and pass-through of commodity prices. The healthy volume growth will, however, come on a low base of FY2021, the agency said in a statement. ""Demand for auto components stems from domestic OEMs, replacement and exports. Domestic OEM demand has remained a mixed bag across segments in FY2022, with a slowdown in two-wheelers (2Ws) and semiconductor shortage dragging down overall production volumes,"" Icra Ltd. Assistant Vice President & Sector Head – Corporate Ratings Vinutaa S said. Exports have remained a bright spot in the Indian auto component story, partly aided by the ""China+1 strategy"". This is despite supply chain issues, she added. ""ICRA believes that the growth in FY2022 exports would have been even better if not for the semiconductor shortage. While auto ancillaries have a healthy export order book for the next few months, the impact of geopolitical and supply-chain issues on actual offtake remains monitorable,"" Ms. Vinutaa said. For FY2023, Icra said, ""Revenues are likely to expand by 8-10% supported by easing of supply-chain issues and commodity inflation in H2 FY2023. Over the long term, premiumisation of vehicles and focus on localisation will translate into healthy growth for auto component suppliers"". The rating agency said cost inflation and semiconductor shortage remain headwinds for the industry. ""Operating margins for auto ancillaries are likely to be impacted in the near term with elevated raw material, fuel and freight prices. While the semiconductor situation has been improving in the last 1-2 months, the Russia-Ukraine conflict could stress the globalised chip value chain,"" it said. In the aftermarket segment, the agency said the improvement in personal mobility, healthy freight movement and deferment of new vehicle purchases due to cost inflation have supported replacement sales in the last few months. Part of the revenue growth has also come from commodity pass-through. While January to mid-February was relatively dull because of the Omicron wave, demand has picked up in the last few weeks.

166," Diesel was no longer on sale across Sri Lanka on Thursday, crippling transport as the crisis-hit country's 22 million people endured record-long power blackouts. The South Asian nation is in the grips of its worst economic downturn since independence, sparked by an acute lack of foreign currency to pay for even the most essential imports. Diesel – the main fuel for buses and commercial vehicles – was unavailable at stations across the island, according to officials and media reports. Petrol was on sale but in short supply, forcing motorists to abandon their cars in long queues. ""We are siphoning off fuel from buses that are in the garage for repairs and using that diesel to operate serviceable vehicles,"" Transport Minister Dilum Amunugama said. Owners of private buses – which account for two-thirds of the country's fleet – said they were already out of oil and that even skeleton services may not be possible after Friday. ""We are still using old stocks of diesel, but if we don't get supplies by this evening, we will not be able to operate,"" chairman of the private bus operators association Gemunu Wijeratne told AFP. The state electricity monopoly said they would be forced to enforce a 13-hour power cut from Thursday – the longest ever – because they did not have diesel for generators. ""We are promised new supplies in two days and if that happens, we can reduce the length of power cuts,"" Ceylon Electricity Board chairman M. M. C. Ferdinando told reporters. He said hydro reservoirs, which provide more than a third of electricity demand, were also dangerously low. The lengthy power cuts forced the Colombo Stock Exchange to limit its trading by half to two hours, while many offices asked non-essential staff to stay at home. The electricity rationing also hit mobile phone base stations and affected the quality of calls, operators said, adding that their stand-by generators were also without diesel. The shortages have sparked outrage across Sri Lanka, with local television reporting protests across the country as hundreds of motorists block main roads in several towns. Several state-run hospitals have stopped surgeries as they have run out of essential life-saving medicines, while most have stopped diagnostic tests which require imported chemicals that are in short supply. Colombo imposed a broad import ban in March 2020 in a bid to save foreign currency needed to service its $51 billion in foreign debt. But this has led to widespread shortages of essential goods and sharp price rises. The government has said it is seeking a bailout from the International Monetary Fund while asking for more loans from India and China. Sri Lanka's predicament was exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which torpedoed tourism and remittances. Many economists also blame government mismanagement including tax cuts and years of budget deficits.","Diesel was no longer on sale across Sri Lanka on Thursday, crippling transport as the crisis-hit country's 22 million people endured record-long power blackouts .

167,"Chinese leader Xi Jinping on March 31 issued strong backing for Afghanistan at a regional conference, while making no mention of human rights abuses by the country's Taliban leaders.  Xi pledged China's support in a message to a gathering of representatives from Afghanistan, China, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in a central Chinese city that spotlights Beijing's aspirations to play a leading role in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of U.S. forces last August. A ""peaceful, stable, developed and prosperous Afghanistan"" is what Afghans aspire to, which ""serves the common interests of regional countries and the international community,"" Xi said.  ""China has all along respected Afghanistan's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and is committed to supporting Afghanistan's peaceful and stable development,"" Xi said in his message to the gathering in Tunxi, a centre of the tourism industry in Anhui province.  Xi gave no specifics, although China has already shipped emergency aid to Afghanistan and is seeking to develop copper mining there.  China follows what it calls a strict policy of ""non-intervention"" in other countries' internal affairs, including opposing those staged for humanitarian purposes unless sanctioned by the United Nations. Despite that, Beijing is frequently accused of meddling to further its own domestic and international interests.  Special envoys for Afghanistan from China, the United States and Russia, a group known as the ""Extended Troika,"" were also meeting concurrently in Tunxi.  Although it has yet to recognise the Taliban government, China has moved quickly to shore up its ties with the radical Islamic group.  A month before the Taliban took power, Foreign Minister Wang Yi hosted a high-powered delegation from the group for a July 28, 2021, meeting in the Chinese port city of Tianjin. Wang referred to the group as ""pivotal"" force important to peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan. On that and other occasions, Chinese have pushed the Taliban for assurances they will not permit operations within Afghanistan's borders by members of China's Turkic Muslim Uyghur minority intent on overthrowing Chinese rule in their native region of Xinjiang.  Wang also made a surprise stop in Kabul last week to meet Taliban leaders, even as the international community fumed over the hard-line movement's broken promise a day earlier to open schools to girls beyond the sixth grade. China has studiously avoided mentioning the limits on girls' education and other human rights abuses, particularly those targeting women, while keeping its Kabul embassy open.  The Foreign Ministers of Qatar and Indonesia have been invited to the meeting of neighbouring states as guests. Taliban-appointed Foreign Minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, is representing Afghanistan at the meeting. ","Chinese leader Xi Jinping issued strong backing for Afghanistan at a regional conference .

168,"Millions of people in China's financial hub were confined to their homes on Monday as the eastern half of Shanghai went into lockdown to curb the country's biggest ongoing Covid-19 outbreak. The move, announced late Sunday, caused a run on grocery stores by residents who have become exasperated with authorities' inability to snuff out the outbreak despite nearly three weeks of increasingly disruptive measures. Authorities are imposing a two-phase lockdown of the city of about 25 million people to carry out mass testing. The government had sought to avoid the hard lockdowns regularly deployed in other Chinese cities, opting instead for rolling localised lockdowns to keep Shanghai's economy running. But Shanghai has in recent weeks become China's Covid hotspot, and on Monday another record high was reported, with 3,500 new confirmed cases in the city.

169," Israeli security services raided the homes of at least 12 Arab citizens and arrested two suspected of having ties to the Islamic State militant group in a crackdown sparked by recent deadly attacks, authorities said on March 29.  Hours before the raid, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the recent assaults inside Israel that left six people dead marked a ""new situation"" that required stepped-up security measures. Law enforcement officials said 31 homes and sites were searched overnight in northern Israel, an area that was home to the gunmen who killed two police officers and wounded four more people in the city of Hadera over the weekend.  The IS militant group claimed responsibility for Sunday's attack, as well as a stabbing rampage in southern Israel last Tuesday that killed four people. Police shot and killed the two gunmen, and the stabber was shot and killed by a passerby, police said. Israeli leaders, condemning the killings, pointed to the timing.  Both attacks came ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and Sunday's killings came on the eve of a high-profile meeting between the Foreign Ministers of four Arab nations and the U.S. in the Israeli Negev. All four Arab nations — Egypt, Morocco, Bahrain and the UAE — along with the U.S., condemned the killings.  Ramadan is expected to begin on Saturday. Last year, clashes between Israeli police and Muslim protesters during the holy month boiled over into an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza. Hamas praised the shooting as a ""heroic operation"".  Attacks by IS inside Israel are rare. The group operates mainly in Iraq and Syria, where it has recently stepped up attacks against security forces. It no longer controls any territory but operates through sleeper cells.  The IS has claimed responsibility for attacks against Israeli troops in the past and has branches in Afghanistan and other countries.

170," Russia reiterated Tuesday that it will only be accepting payment for gas deliveries to the EU in rubles after G7 ministers called this arrangement ""unacceptable"". ""Nobody will supply gas for free. This is just impossible. And it can only be paid for in rubles,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""Companies must understand the completely changed environment that has arisen in the conditions of the economic war waged against Russia,"" he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that Moscow will now only accept rubles as payment for natural gas deliveries to ""unfriendly"" countries, which include the European Union. Western countries have piled crippling sanctions on Moscow since it moved troops into Ukraine, with the United States banning the import of Russia oil and gas among other measures. However, the European Union — which received around 40% of its gas supplies from Russia in 2021 — has retained deliveries from Moscow. Speaking on behalf of the G7 energy ministers, Germany's Robert Habeck said Monday that Russia's request was a ""unilateral and clear breach of the existing agreements"".

On Thursday, the Russian government, its central bank and energy giant Gazprom are expected to present Putin with a system that will allow gas payment to be conducted in rubles.

171,"Making the quarterfinals at a tournament used to be no big deal for Naomi Osaka. It was only a shock if it didn't happen. Things are a bit different now. The former world No. 1 has made it through to the quarterfinals at the Miami Open — just the second time she has managed to advance that deep in any tournament over the last year. Osaka beat Alison Riske of the U.S. 6-3, 6-4 on Monday, moving into a round-of-eight matchup with Danielle Collins. Osaka's only other quarterfinal appearance in the last year was at an Australian Open warmup tournament in Melbourne in January. Before that, her most recent quarterfinals trip was at Miami a year ago. ""It's really funny for me, because last year here I made it to the quarters, too,"" Osaka said. ""It was after I won Australia and I wasn't that grateful. I kind of expected to win."" Wins these days just mean more, after ongoing struggles and time away from the game to deal with her mental health. Her ranking in the world has dipped to No. 77 — it could get somewhere around No. 30 if she wins the Miami title — and she hasn't won a tournament since that Australian Open victory last year. But her stay in Miami so far has been nothing but happiness, with three easy wins — all in straight sets — and the added benefit of a walkover victory in there as well. ""This is really one of the funnest times of my life,"" Osaka said. ""I'm really grateful."" Collins, the No. 9 seed from the U.S., needed just over an hour Monday to win her fourth-round match against No. 8 Ons Jabeur, 6-2, 6-4. The win likely ensured that Collins is locked into the top 10 when the world rankings reset early next week. She could be as high as No. 8 depending on how far others go in the tournament. Collins is 0-2 in previous matches against Osaka, both straight-set losses on hard courts, one in 2018, the other in 2019. ""When Naomi is at the top of her game, she's very, very hard to beat,"" Collins said. Daria Saville also got into the quarterfinals, surviving a three-hour match to beat Lucia Bronzetti 5-7, 6-4, 7-5. Saville has climbed a staggering 500 spots in the world rankings in about a month and a half; she was 627th in the world in mid-February and could make the top 100 if she wins her next match against either No. 22 Belinda Bencic or Aliaksandra Sasnovich. No. 2 Iga Swiatek, who is already assured of moving to No. 1 next week, also rolled into the quarterfinals with a 6-3, 6-1 win over No. 14 Coco Gauff. In the men's third round, Daniil Medvedev is now two wins away from reclaiming the No. 1 world ranking. The top seed in Miami beat Spain's Pedro Martinez 6-3, 6-4. A trip to the semifinals is all it would take for Medvedev to leapfrog Novak Djokovic and return to No. 1. Next up for Medvedev: American Jenson Brooksby, who rallied from 0-4 down in the third set to upset No. 15 Roberto Bautista Agut 6-3, 5-7, 6-4. ""I competed until the end,"" Brooksby said. Defending champion Hubert Hurkacz also advanced, the No. 8 seed fighting past No. 29 Aslan Karatsev 7-5, 4-6, 6-3. No. 14 Carlos Alcaraz got by No. 21 Marin Cilic 6-4, 6-4.","Naomi Osaka beats Alison Riske of the U.S. 6-3, 6-4 at the Miami Open .

172,"Apple has planned to cut production of iPhone SEs, AirPods amid the Russia-Ukraine war uncertainty that continues for more than a month now, according to a report by Nikkei Asia. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today's Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) Per the revised plan, the company will make about 20% fewer iPhone SEs next quarter than originally planned. The Cupertino-based company launched the iPhone SE as its first 5G-capable budget phone less than three weeks back but is now telling multiple suppliers to lower production orders by about 2 - 3 million units for the next quarter, citing weaker-than-expected demand, the paper noted. The tech company also reduced orders for its AirPods earphones by more than 10 million units for all of 2022. Apple will also cut production of the entire iPhone 13 range than previously planned, but said that to be a seasonal adjustment. Apple already stopped all product sales in Russia after the outbreak of the Ukraine war.  Apple is among the top five smartphone and computer maker in Russia, according to estimates by IDC.  Nikkei's report sees the move by Apple could have an effect on the supply chain as other consumer electronics makers may trim production orders in an uncertain market.","Apple to cut production of iPhone SEs, AirPods amid Russia-Ukraine war uncertainty, Nikkei Asia report says .

173,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday attributed the fuel price hikes to disruptions in global oil markets over the past 'couple of weeks' due to the war in Ukraine, and said the government has an 'honest' approach towards oil prices unlike the UPA which relied on oil bonds.  The minister also said she expects the Wholesale Price Inflation to moderate in the coming year, while responding to the debate on the Finance Bill and Appropriation Bill of 2022 in the Rajya Sabha. The Upper House of Parliament returned the two Bills, completing the Budget 2022-23 exercise.  ""I am tempted to talk about the oil prices. Just one line will probably explain it. We are dealing with a situation arising out of the global war-like situation. It was said that the war has been raging for a time and you didn't raise it at that time, now you are raising it,"" Ms. Sitharaman said in an 80-odd minute reply to points raised by MPs.  ""[This is] Absolutely untrue, Sir. The disruption and the resultant increase in price of global oil and also disruption to supplies are all happening since a couple of weeks ago and we are responding to it. Various steps have been taken by the government,"" she said, noting that inflation is being controlled in items like pulses.  Conceding that the NDA government led by Atal Behari Vajpayee had also issued oil bonds worth Rs. 9,000 crore, the minister said that was a one-time action unlike UPA's 'continuous policy' leading to issuance of oil bonds worth Rs. 2 lakh crore that are still being repaid.  ""The taxpayers of today are paying for subsidy dished out to consumers more than a decade ago in the name of oil bonds. And they will continue to pay for another five years,"" she asserted. ""So there is a honest way of funding oil at a higher cost and a way in which you just book it on somebody else and some other government keeps paying for it. We have not done that,"" said Ms. Sitharaman.  Terming the government's GDP growth estimates in the Budget as 'conservative', the minister said the Budget had not factored in the Omicron wave and highlighted the Russia-Ukraine war and the unprecedented hike in fuel prices as a new challenge.  ""However, I want to submit before the members that we take a whole year's picture for the economy, rather than reviewing it or reassessing it on a weekly or even a monthly basis. So far as the inflation is concerned, the Wholesale Price Index in the deflator has been very high this year compared to the Consumer Price Inflation (CPI). We are hopeful that the WPI indices will shrink going forward,"" she noted.  Taking on former Finance Minister P Chidambaram's critique of the Finance Bill and a query he raised about whether the government has lost its faith in private investors, Ms. Sitharaman said this was a very odd issue to flag.  ""The pandemic created huge uncertainties that seriously impacted private sector investments. The government stepped in to fill the gap and create an environment necessary to revive and sustain investments from the private sector. We believe the government and private sector are partners in ushering development in the economy. There is no 'Us vs Them' when it comes to government versus private sector,"" she noted, adding that higher public capital spending will help crowd in private investments.

174,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), in its board meeting held in Mumbai on Tuesday, approved among others an amendment to the SEBI (Collective Investment Schemes) Regulations, 1999 to strengthen the regulatory framework for collective investment schemes (CIS) in line with mutual fund regulations to remove regulatory arbitrage. Some of the key amendments included enhancement of net-worth criteria and requirement of having track record in relevant field as an eligibility requirement for registration as a collective investment management company (CIMC). Also, CIMC and its group/ associates/ shareholders will be restricted to 10% shareholding or representation on the board of another CIMC to avoid conflict of interest. There will be a mandatory investment of CIMC and its designated employees in the Collective Investment Schemes (CIS) to align their interest with that of the CIS. Also, there will be mandatory requirement of minimum number of investors, maximum holding of a single investor, and minimum subscription amount at the CIS level. As per the amendment, there has been rationalisation of fee and expenses to be charged to the scheme. And there has been reduction of timelines for offer period of scheme, allotment of units, and refund of money to investors. The board also approved a proposal to amend the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, for simplification of procedure for transmission of securities.

176,"Defending champions England became the third team to book its place in the semifinals of the Women's World Cup with a comfortable 100-run win over Bangladesh here on Sunday.  Sophia Dunkley's 72-ball 67 helped the reigning champions post 234 for six at Basin Reserve and a polished bowling performance, led yet again by Sophie Ecclestone's economical spell of 3/15, meant Bangladesh never threatened to rein in England's total and were bowled out for 134 in the 48th over.  England have now won four matches on the trot, having more than made up for their slow start to the tournament with a string of impressive performances that has highlighted the depth in their squad.  Experienced seamer Anya Shrubsole was rested on Sunday, paving the way for Charlie Dean (3/31) and Freya Davies (2/36) to show their prowess as Knight used seven different bowlers to successfully negate the Bangladesh batters.  Ecclestone did it best as she maintained her spot at the top of the leading wicket taker tally at the tournament with another superb spell, while Knight (1/15) bowled some valuable overs of her own.  All-rounder Lata Mondal top-scored for Bangladesh with 30 and openers Shamima Sultana and Sharmin Akhter made 23 apiece, but none of their batters found scoring easy to come by against England's quality bowlers.  Earlier, Dunkley helped pace England to their total during the important middle overs as Nat Sciver (40), Tammy Beaumont (33) and Amy Jones (31) provided plenty of support.  Salma Khatun (2/46) was the pick of the Bangladesh bowlers, who combined well to make sure England couldn't gather too much momentum throughout their innings.  England's quest to reach the knockout stages of the tournament actually started poorly, with Danni Wyatt (6) and Knight (6) falling inside the first eight overs and the score only on 26.  Sciver and Beaumont put on 60 for the third wicket to help get England back on track, but Beaumont was dismissed by Ritu Moni with the first ball of the 25th over as Bangladesh fought back strongly.  While Dunkley held the innings together, Katherine Brunt (24 not out) scored some valuable runs towards the end runs to ensure England to reach the winning total.  First-timers Bangladesh finished the tournament in seventh place on the standings with just one win from eight matches. Brief Scores:  England Women: (For 6 wickets in 50 overs) 234 (Sophia Dunkley 67, Nat Sciver 40; Salma Khatun 2/46).

177,"Petrol price on Sunday was hiked by 50 paise a litre and diesel by 55 paise, taking the total increase in rates since resumption of daily price revision less than a week back to ₹3.70-3.75 per litre. Petrol in Delhi will now cost ₹99.11 per litre as against ₹98.61 previously while diesel rates have gone up from ₹89.87 per litre to ₹90.42, according to a price notification of State fuel retailers. Rates have been increased across the country and vary from State to State depending upon the incidence of local taxation. This is the fifth increase in prices since the ending of a four-and-half-month long hiatus in rate revision on March 22. On all the previous four occasions, prices had been increased by 80 paise a litre—the steepest single-day rise since the daily price revision was introduced in June 2017. In all, petrol prices have gone up by ₹3.70 per litre and diesel by ₹3.75 in six days. Prices had been on a freeze since November 4 ahead of the assembly elections in States like Uttar Pradesh and Punjab—a period during which the cost of raw material (crude oil) soared by about $30 per barrel. The rate revision was expected soon after counting of votes on March 10 but it was put off by a couple of weeks apparently to not give opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi a handle to say that they had rightly predicted that prices will go up after elections. Congress and other opposition parties have criticised the government for the price rise saying it has added to the burden on common man reeling under general commodity price rise. The increase in retail price warranted from crude oil prices rising during the 137 day hiatus from around $82 per barrel to $120 is huge but State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) are passing on the required increase in stages. Moody's Investors Services last week stated that state retailers together lost around $2.25 billion (₹19,000 crore) in revenue for keeping petrol and diesel prices on hold during the election period. Oil companies ""will need to raise diesel prices by Rs 13.1-24.9 per litre and Rs 10.6-22.3 a litre on gasoline (petrol) at an underlying crude price of USD 100-120 per barrel,"" according to Kotak Institutional Equities. CRISIL Research said a ₹9-12 per litre increase in retail price will be required for a full pass-through of an average $100 per barrel crude oil and ₹15-20 a litre hike if the average crude oil price rises to $110-120. India is 85% dependent on imports for meeting its oil needs and so retail rates adjust accordingly to the global movement.","Petrol price on Sunday was hiked by 50 paise a litre and diesel by 55 paise, taking the total increase in rates since resumption of daily price revision less than a week back to ?3.70-3.75 per litre .
